I was and still in a rush to finish my thesis, but I believe I need to calm down and write the first sentences of my thesis that I should have started three years ago. I feel so happy when I remember the good memories that helped me to finish this thesis. I sincerely thank my supervisors, who gave me the autonomy in this thesis and trust me completely. Julien Némery, you are the true supervisor that I always want to be. I really thank you for your availability and concern, not only for this thesis but for everything. Nicolas Gratiot, I thank you for your trust, for your help from the very first day I started working at CARE. Thanh-Son Dao, a true teacher and scientist who has been most respected since I was a student in Vietnam. You have given me lessons in meticulousness in doing science. Your spirit of doing true science is always a source of motivation for me. Thank you for your support during the sampling missions for Saigon River, and during the COVID lockdown.

I would like to thank my friends at CARE for supporting me on my sampling trips. Le Thi Minh Tam, Tran Quoc Viet, I will never forget the days working with you. The parties after the sampling missions were so memorable. I thank Emilie Strady for your help and support since 2015 and until now. Perhaps you were one of the first teachers who helped me get into science. I would like to express my sincere thanks to Nguyen Phuoc Dan. You are the person who is always ready to help me, the difficulties in collecting data for the model are solved by you. I would like to thank the leadership of CARE for facilitating me in sampling and analysis.

The first days of my PhD were the most unforgettable days for me because of the help of so many people for my thesis. I am really lucky to work with METIS team, Paris. You have helped me open up a research path that is right for me. Josette Garnier, you have been my mentor for more than three years. I always hope one day I will become a good scientist like you. I thank Vincent Thieu, you are probably the most attentive co-author of what I wrote in my first article. Goulven Laruelle, I really appreciate your guidance on the C-GEM model during the early days of my PhD. I thank Georges Vachaud (IGE) very much for your overwhelming support. You have spent a lot of time discussing and helping me with many ideas for my thesis. I would also like to thank you for your wishes in every Tet holiday.

A warm thank you to my colleagues at IGE. Sincere thanks to IGE for giving me a professional but warm working environment. Thank you to all of you who have been in room 139. Nico Hachgenei, thank you for your sincerity and listening. You are the one who has helped me learn so many new skills over the past three years. Perhaps you are the foreigner that I meet the most. Romane Caracciolo, thank you for your interest and questions about the Saigon River. Thank Tuyet Nguyen for many advices and discussion. Thanks to Carméline and Valérie for helping me deal with administrative procedures in France. Marc Descloitres, I am very pleased with the discussions with you about teaching methods. Many thanks go to Sylvain Campillo (Isterre) for your help in sample analysis.

I would like to thank my friends in France who always help me and my little family. Thank you to Edmond and Vincent (Coup De Pouce) for your efforts in improving my French. Thank you to Marie-Pierre Viallet's family for always supporting my family during the past three years. You will always be one of my family members. I would like to thank Mr. Ngoc and Ms. Van for your warmly support for us.

I cannot imagine how I would have completed this thesis without the unconditional support of my wife (ma Vy). You have left so much things in Vietnam to let me pursue my scientific career. I am always grateful for your sacrifices for me and for our petit Vinh. Thank you son for being a source of inspiration for me to get everything done. After all, family is still the most important thing. Finally, I would like to thank my parents who have always been proud of their children.
