<p>This chapter describes the research area and methods to study the biogeochemical functioning of an urbanized tropical estuary by monitoring, experiment, statistical analysis and modeling.</p>
<p>The area of study is Saigon River Estuary, located in the South of Vietnam, with the characteristics of tropical estuaries strongly impacted by urbanization (Ho Chi Minh megacity). The topographic, morphological and hydrological features of Saigon River Estuary are presented first. The urbanization of HCMC is then presented for the 1979 to 2020 period and trends for 2050. The pollution status of Saigon River Estuary is reported based on the previous studies. Finally, water management plans of this urbanized estuary (e.g., construction, upgrading of waste treatment system) are discussed to assess water pollution risks in the future.</p>
<p>In terms of research methods, this study was conducted in the period 2018-2021. In addition to available hydrological and water quality data from the national environmental monitoring center, we collected nutrients, carbon, phytoplankton, and greenhouse gases concentration data. Multivariate statistical methods were used to evaluate the correlation between explanatory variables (e.g., environmental, hydrological parameters) and responses (e.g., greenhouse gases, phytoplankton densities). Finally, a biogeochemical estuarine model for tropical estuaries is presented in detail, from the platform model to the setup protocol to allow the reader to replicate this research for another area.</p>

<p>Vietnam is a coastal country stretching over 3260 km from the north (subtropical climate) to the south (tropical climate). Nearly half of Vietnam’s cities are adjacent to the sea and have a large population living there. The coastal areas of Vietnam have been affected by urbanization and climate change for many years. Vietnam’s three largest river estuarine systems that play the most important role in Vietnam’s economy are the Red River Delta, the Saigon - Dongnai river basin, and the Mekong River Delta (Figure <a href="method.html#fig:C2-SG-DEM">2.1</a> ). In the Mekong Delta, many studies have assessed the impacts of climate change, particularly sea level rise and subsidence affecting the country’s agriculture. Mainly studies have also been carried out in the Red River Delta to assess agricultural activity and urbanization on water quality. The Saigon - Dongnai river basin is a special area, mainly affected by the region’s rapid urbanization, especially the megacity of HCMC.</p>

<p><strong>Location</strong></p>
<p>The Saigon River Estuary is located in the south of Vietnam, part of the Saigon-Dongnai River basin. The Saigon River flows through Tay Ninh, Binh Duong, Dongnai, HCMC and Long An administrative provinces. The Saigon River Basin has a total area of 4717 <span class="math inline">\(km^{2}\)</span> and borders the following areas in turn:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The North and the Northwest border Cambodia, a country with many-sided relations with Vietnam in terms of politics, economy and culture.</p></li>
<li><p>The southeast direction borders the East Sea of Vietnam and provides marine resources, oil, gas, and international shipping.</p></li>
<li><p>The southwest direction borders the Mekong River Delta, which mainly produces food, aquatic products and fruit trees. HCMC is about 170 km from the largest city of the Mekong Delta (Can Tho City).</p></li>
<li><p>The North and the Northeast border with the highland area, which is mainly for crops.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Topography</strong></p>
<p>The Saigon River originates from the Vietnam-Cambodia border area with terrain about 200 m high and is controlled at Dau Tieng Reservoir in the territory of Vietnam. Dau Tieng reservoir is one of the largest reservoirs in Vietnam, with a total water surface area of 270 <span class="math inline">\(km^{2}\)</span>, a volume of 1580 million <span class="math inline">\(m^3\)</span>. Dau Tieng Reservoir regulates floods and aims at mitigating saline intrusion downstream, storing fresh water and supplying irrigation water to Tay Ninh, Binh Duong, Binh Phuoc provinces and HCMC. From Dau Tieng Reservoir to the estuary mouth (about 200 km), the Saigon River has a small slope of about 1.3% (Figure <a href="method.html#fig:C2-SG-DEM">2.1</a>). Elevation of more than 100 km from estuary mouth is less than 2 m; the areas surrounding this river are thus sensitive to saline intrusion and flooding, as a hydrological response of the watershed to rainfall and tide.</p>

<p>Located in the tropics, the Saigon River Estuary experiences two distinct seasons: the rainy and dry seasons. The rainy season is from May to November (hot and humid climate, high temperature with lots of rain), and the dry season is from December to April of next year (dry climate, high temperature and little rain). This area has 160 to 270 hours of sunshine <span class="math inline">\(month^{-1}\)</span> (Figure <a href="method.html#fig:C2-Rain">2.2</a>), with an average temperature of 27<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C, maximum up to 40<span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C, and minimum down to 13.8 <span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C. Solar radiation intensity is of about 4.5 kWh <span class="math inline">\(m^{-2}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span>and of about 1100 kWh<span class="math inline">\(yr^{-1}\)</span> (Figure <a href="method.html#fig:C2-wind">2.3</a>). The average daytime temperature ranges mainly from 25 to 28 <span class="math inline">\(^\circ\)</span>C. The average rainfall is 2000 mm <span class="math inline">\(yr^{-1}\)</span>, of which 90% falls during the rainy season (about 159 rainy days <span class="math inline">\(yr^{-1}\)</span> with about 200 – 500 mm <span class="math inline">\(month^{-1}\)</span>) (HCMC Statistical Year Book, 2010 to 2016).</p>

<p>In terms of hydrology, the Saigon River and its estuary have a very diverse network of rivers and canals. The Saigon River is about 30 m in width upstream and about 225-370 m in HCMC. The average water depth is 18 m. From Dau Tieng Reservoir to the estuary mouth, 200 km downstream, the Saigon River (18 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 14 <span class="math inline">\(m^3s^{-1}\)</span>) joins, in turn, several notable tributaries such as the Thi Tinh River (20 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 11 <span class="math inline">\(m^3s^{-1}\)</span>) and the Dongnai River (632 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 446 <span class="math inline">\(m^3s^{-1}\)</span>) (Figure <a href="method.html#fig:C2-discharge">2.6</a>), forming Long Tau River and flowing through Can Gio Mangrove and into the East Sea of Vietnam (Figure <a href="method.html#fig:C2-Bathymetry">2.4</a> ). In addition, the Saigon River is connected to an urban river (Vam Thuat River, 4 <span class="math inline">\(m^3s^{-1}\)</span>) and three urban canals of HCMC (combined discharge of 5.5 <span class="math inline">\(m^3s^{-1}\)</span>) before the confluence with Dongnai River <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2020">T. T. N. Nguyen et al. 2020</a>)</span>. The semi-diurnal regime influences the Saigon River from the East Sea of Vietnam (Figure <a href="method.html#fig:C2-Tide">2.5</a> ). The tidal amplitude ranges from 1.5 m during neap tide to about 4 m during a spring tide <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Schwarzer2016">Schwarzer, Thanh, and Ricklefs 2016</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>HCMC, formerly known as Saigon (before 1975), has the largest population and fastest growth rate in Vietnam. The Saigon River is mainly located in the territory of this city and directly receives wastewater from human activities through a system of canals, as shown in Figure <a href="method.html#fig:C2-Bathymetry">2.4</a>. The population in 1929 was 123,890 people, of which 12,100 were French, and its population reached 498,000 people in 1943. In 1967 the city had grown threefold with a population of 1.5 million people. However, this population increase was mainly due to immigration <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-TapchiCongThuong2021">Nguyen Van Tien 2021</a>)</span>. Since 1979, HCMC’s population has grown rapidly from more than 3 million to 9 million by 2020. The population distribution in HCMC is uneven. While some districts such as 4, 5, 10 and 11 have densities of over 40,000 inhabitants <span class="math inline">\(km^{-2}\)</span> , the suburban district of Can Gio has a relatively low density of 100 persons <span class="math inline">\(km^{-2}\)</span> (Figure <a href="method.html#fig:C2-Landuse">2.7</a>). Regarding population growth, while the natural growth rate is about 1.07%, the mechanical growth rate is up to 2.5% (Source: General Statistics Office Of Vietnam - GSO, 2019). The population growth rate also varied each period, the period 1999-2009 was 3.5%, while the period 2009-2019 was lower with an increased rate of 2.3%. If based on the average population growth rate of 2.8%, the population of HCMC is estimated to be more than 20 million people by 2050 <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2020">T. T. N. Nguyen et al. 2020</a>)</span>. However, according to UN World Urbanization Prospects 2018, the population growth rate in HCMC will decrease from 2.8% in 2019 to 1.3% in 2050. The population of HCMC is thus estimated at 16 million people in 2050. This estimate is appropriate because the HCMC government is increasingly taking measures to control immigration in the future (Source: Vietnam Ministry of Construction, 2020).</p>
<p>HCMC is the largest economic and trading center of Vietnam. The city occupies about 0.6% area but 10% population of Vietnam and accounts for more than 30% of the value of industrial production and 35% of foreign projects. The economy of HCMC is diversified from mining, fisheries, agriculture, processing industry, construction to tourism, finance. Regarding economic sectors, services accounted for the highest proportion, about 50%. The industry and construction accounted for 48%, while agriculture, forestry and fishery accounted for only 2% (HCMC statistics book, 2016). In 2020, HCMC had 24 export processing zones and industrial parks with about 62 <span class="math inline">\(km^{2}\)</span>. All industrial parks in HCMC have centralized wastewater treatment systems. Up to now, HCMC is the first city in the country to reach the target of 100% of industrial parks operating with centralized wastewater treatment systems of 63000 <span class="math inline">\(m^3\)</span><span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span>(www.hepza.gov.vn). Thus, if the WWTPs of these industrial parks are operated according to the design, wastewater from these industrial zones should not be a source of pollution for the Saigon River.</p>

<p>The sewerage and sanitation system of HCMC was built in the 1870s during the French colonial period. Until now, domestic water and rainwater have been collected and transported together by the sewer system and by urban canals and creeks
<span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-TranNgoc2016">Tran Ngoc et al. 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The current WWTPs system in HCMC cannot deal with the total domestic wastewater volume of about 9 million people (about 2.5 million <span class="math inline">\(m^3\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span>). Before 2006, all domestic wastewater was discharged directly into canals and the Saigon River; treated wastewater is about 12% in 2021 (Figure <a href="method.html#fig:C2-population">2.8</a>).

However, there are currently only three WWTPs in operation; one WWTP is under construction, while other WWTPs are still in the fundraising stage. The total estimated cost is over 2 billion USD for the remaining WWTPs.

<p>The water quality of the Saigon River is assessed to be directly affected by domestic wastewater from the HCMC megacity. Therefore, the HCMC government has had programs to monitor the water quality of the Saigon River since the 1990s. This program is completed with monitoring points from Dau Tieng Reservoir to the estuary and other sampling sites in the urban canals, with a monthly frequency since 2012.</p>
<p>By 2019, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of Vietnam (Decision 154/QD-TCMT, February 15, 2019), the water quality of major rivers affected by tides in Vietnam must be simulated by two software QUAL2K and MIKE 11. The requirement to use this two software is to calculate the total maximum daily loads of rivers (Source: Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of Vietnam - MONRE, 2019). The QUAL2K model is applied to the north of Vietnam because of its low tidal influence. The MIKE model is used to the south of Vietnam because of its ability to solve tidal problems (MONRE, 2019). Therefore, many Vietnamese scientists have applied the MIKE model to simulate hydraulic processes in the Saigon River. However, currently, there is only one study using the MIKE model to assess water quality in the Saigon River <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2019b">H. D. Nguyen et al. 2019</a>)</span>. The remaining studies mainly evaluate saline intrusion. In addition, the researches on water quality modeling in Vietnam are mostly used internally, rarely published internationally. To the author’s knowledge, there has been no published assessment of biogeochemical processes and hydrological regimes on the changes in the Saigon River’s water quality and the risk of eutrophication under the impact of urbanization.</p>

<p>During 20 years of monitoring the water quality of the Saigon River, the dissolved oxygen concentration in the 2000s was very low. In 2008, the water quality improved thanks to the operation of WWTPs (but only 10% of the total wastewater was treated). The water quality improvement is also supported by the activities of dredging canals in the inner city. However, almost all the canals suffered serious pollution levels during this period, and fish deaths were frequent (Figure <a href="method.html#fig:C2-Fish">2.11</a>). In recent years, DO concentration has tended to decrease gradually and often until anoxic conditions (Figure <a href="method.html#fig:C2-DO">2.12</a>). Concentrations of pollutants in this river are still highly fluctuating but note that it is on a deteriorating trend.</p>

<p>Managing water quality in the Saigon River is to control the source of domestic wastewater before being discharged into the canal system and the Saigon River. However, the planification construction of 12 WWTPs is expected to cost more than 2 billion USD, while the construction of only one WWTP had lasted from 10 years before operation. Therefore, the step-by-step planning of construction and selection of treatment technology will be extremely important to the financial viability of the region. Similar to the lessons on water pollution control from the Seine River (France) or Shenzhen Bay (China), solutions to reduce pollutants need to be based on research and support of biogeochemical models. This can optimize costs and improve the effectiveness of future pollution mitigation in the context of HCMC’s rapid urbanization.</p>

<p>Vietnamese Center of Monitoring (CEM) of the Department of Natural Resources and Environment of HCMC (DONRE) has been responsible for monitoring water quality and hydrology in the Saigon River since the 2000s. After many modifications of the monitoring strategy, by 2012, this program was operating more stably. CEM surveyed 26 points along the Saigon River and its tributaries (approximately 300 km in total length) and 15 points in the urban canals (Figure <a href="method.html#fig:C2-CEMsite">2.13</a> for sampling sites using in this study). The measured parameters include temperature, pH, TSS, salinity, turbidity, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_{4}^{+}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span>, COD, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{BOD_5}\)</span>, DO, metals (Pb, Cu, Cd, Hd, Mn), oil, coliforms and <em>E. coli</em>. Monitoring frequency is bi-weekly for locations along the river and monthly for sampling sites at urban canals.</p>

<p>This bi-weekly monitoring program is conducted by Center Asiatique de Recherche sur l’Eau (CARE, Vietnam). This program has been implemented since 07/2015 and continues to survey the temporal evolution of water quality in three areas along the Saigon River and one area in the Dongnai River (Figure <a href="method.html#fig:C2-CARE">2.14</a>). Four sampling sites represent four areas of (i) an upstream station on the Saigon River (SG01) representative of the reference water status before HCMC, (ii) a station located in the urban area (SG10) representative of the impact of the megacity and (iii) a downstream station after the confluence of the Saigon and Dongnai Rivers (SG18) that aims at assessing the global impact of HCMC to the estuarine and coastal waters. Four sampling sites of CARE coincide with the sampling location of CEM. However, CARE analyzed additional indicators including POC, DOC, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_{3}^{-}}\)</span>, TN, TP, Chl-a, phytoplankton density.</p>

<p>At the survey site, water samples were taken about 30 cm below the water surface and stored in a 2.5 L polypropylene flask for phytoplankton analysis and a 5 L flask for nutrient analysis. The sample was taken during low tide when the Saigon River receives water from tributaries and urban canals. Samples were taken at the mid-river location by using boats or bridges. Physicochemical parameters of water samples were measured immediately using the multi-parameter probe (WTW 3420), including temperature, pH, conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen concentration and percentage of oxygen saturation.</p>
<p>In addition to water quality monitoring, CARE measures the water level and calculates the discharge by a high-resolution (10-minute) probe for 2017 – 2019 in the upstream area of the Saigon River <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Camenen2021">Camenen et al. 2021</a>)</span>.

<p>Four sampling campaigns were conducted at 27 sampling sites covering 141 km of Saigon River and four sampling sites in urban canals of HCMC (close to SG07, SG09, SG11 and SG12) in dry (April 2019 and March 2020) and the rainy season (October 2019 and 2020) (Figure <a href="method.html#fig:C2-CARE">2.14</a> and Figure <a href="method.html#fig:C2-sampling">2.15</a>). Each campaign was carried out on three consecutive days: 14 sampling sites (UP01 – SG 10) on the first day, four sampling sites in urban canals on the second day and 13 sampling sites (SG10 – SG23) on the third day. A GPS was used to mark each point’s longitude and latitude values and calculate the distance (km) point to point.

<p>The eutrophication status in the estuarine and coastal areas can be assessed by the trophic index (TRIX). The TRIX index was previously applied in several countries, such as Mahanadi estuary, India <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Srichandan2019">Srichandan et al. 2019</a>)</span>, Foz de Almargem coastal lagoon, Portugal <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Coelho2007">Coelho, Gamito, and Pérez-Ruzafa 2007</a>)</span>.

<p>C-GEM uses an idealized representation of the estuarine geometry, which can describe the estuarine width by an exponential equation along the estuary gradient.</p>

<p>Where x is the distance from estuarine mouth [m], B0 is the width at estuarine mouth (x = 0) [m], b is the width convergence length [m]. Convergence length is an important parameter linking geometry and hydrodynamics at tidal estuaries. It will be used to calculate the diffusion coefficient of the pollutant transport equation. This is the parameter that reduces the data requirements for hydrodynamics modeling at tidal estuaries.</p>

Currently, the C-GEM model is only suitable for well-mixed estuaries where biogeochemical processes mainly occur in the water column.

<p>The primary production process corresponds to the growth of phytoplankton and oxygen production through the uptake of C, N, P, and Si in the water column under soluble form depending on environmental forcings, especially light penetration. The light availability in the water column is affected by Total Suspended Sediment (TSS), which is calculated by the model through the simulation of erosion deposition processes. Nitrification consumes DO in the water column, which potentially eliminates a high concentration of ammonium. Denitrification contributes to anaerobic TOC consumption, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> production and nitrogen elimination by converting <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_{3}^{-}}\)</span> into the inert <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2}\)</span> gas that escapes from the water column into the atmosphere.

Phosphate release from bottom sediment might have a high impact on the phosphorus simulation at shallow estuaries <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Vilmin2015">Vilmin et al. 2015</a>)</span>. Note that the modular structure of C-GEM allows for a relatively simple implementation of new processes in its biogeochemical module and increasing the complexity of the N and P cycles could be the subject of future studies.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the sediment processes (erosion deposition) in the C-GEM model do not directly affect the geomorphological processes of the riverbed. The setup of sediment transport in C-GEM is mainly aimed at assessing the influence of suspended sediments on light diffusion and phytoplankton growth in the water column.

<p>The data required to implement the C-GEM model for Saigon River depends on spatio–temporal scales. A steady-state version of C-GEM is established to determine the dominant biogeochemical processes and the influence of average tidal-resolved conditions in the absence of high-resolution data. The data requirements for steady-state C-GEM are shown in Table <a href="#tab:CH2-table1-data"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The steady-state version does not allow the estimation of the evolution of seasonal variables and phytoplankton development, which also cannot be determined by conventional monitoring. Therefore, the C-GEM model is applied to Saigon River Estuary with a steady-state version first (Chapter 4) and then a transient version (Chapter 5) with more data availability.</p>

<p>With a steady-state version, C-GEM needs 10 m wind speed and sunshine duration. Wind speed requires calculating oxygen exchange surface water and atmosphere. Sunshine duration is to calculate irradiation for the photosynthesis rate of phytoplankton. Climate condition data were obtained from the statistical office of HCMC (www.pso.hochiminhcity.gov.vn) with the monthly resolution.</p>
<p>With the transient version, C-GEM uses online-high resolution data from <a href="http://www.lthe.fr/LTHE/IMG/LOGGERNET/IGE-MeteoCARE" class="uri">http://www.lthe.fr/LTHE/IMG/LOGGERNET/IGE-MeteoCARE</a>, the CARE weather station, which provides 10 minutes wind speed and solar radiation.

<p>With the steady-state version, C-GEM needs the average daily discharge at upstream of Saigon Estuary. In addition, the C-GEM requires tidal period and tidal range for a description of generic tidal variation from East Sea Vietnam. Indeed, the steady-state version acts as a quasi-hydrodynamic model with all input parameters constant, but the results are still representative for the fluctuations of the variables over a representative tidal cycle.</p>
<p>The discharge from urban canals of HCMC is calculated based on water usage per capita <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2020">T. T. N. Nguyen et al. 2020</a>)</span>. Discharge from tributaries, including Thi Tinh River, Dongnai River, is interpolated from monthly discharge to daily discharge, provided by CEM. However, to avoid misinterpretations from interpolation, the discharge values of the monitoring month will be equal to all days of that month. These errors mainly affect the simulation results downstream of the Saigon River, while the upstream and urban areas are only affected by upstream discharge. At the lower boundary, the water level at the estuary mouth is provided by hourly water level from the Vung Tau station, East Sea Vietnam (<a href="https://uhslc.soest.hawaii.edu/data/" class="uri">https://uhslc.soest.hawaii.edu/data/</a>).</p>

<p>C-GEM was designed to account for the interdependency between geometry and hydrodynamics in tidal alluvial estuaries. The width convergence length, which controls the system’s shape, is thus a very sensitive parameter for hydrodynamics. Therefore, the value of the convergence length was carefully calibrated against observations (Figure <a href="method.html#fig:C2-Model-Depth">2.22</a>). The impact of freshwater flow on this estuarine morphology was very different between the upstream (before Dongnai River confluence) and downstream sections <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Gugliotta2020">Gugliotta et al. 2020</a>)</span>. The estuarine width ranges from 60 m from Dau Tieng Reservoir (km 0) to 350 m (km 140) and rapidly increases to 3690 m at the estuary mouth. This particular geometry justifies the use of a second convergence length to reproduce the entire width profile of the Saigon River Estuary. C-GEM geometry used a short convergence length from the estuary mouth (km 200) to the confluence of the Saigon and Dongnai rivers (km 142). From this confluence to the upstream section (km 142 – km 0), the width of the river only decreases slowly and gradually (with a longer convergence length). Such a strategy was previously used with C-GEM for applications to other estuaries <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Laruelle2019">Goulven G. Laruelle et al. 2019</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Volta2016b">C. Volta, Laruelle, and Regnier 2016</a>)</span>.
The depth of the Saigon River Estuary gradually increases from 2.5 m at the outlet of Dau Tieng reservoir to 19 m at km 60. The river’s depth is then almost constant over the next 80 km (i.e., until the confluence with the Dongnai River); it then decreases gradually to 9.6 m at the estuary mouth. The idealized geometry in the model captured well the mean estuarine depth and width, which were extracted from 83 cross-sections of the bathymetry (Figure <a href="method.html#fig:C2-Model-Depth">2.22</a>).</p>

<p>The one-dimensional hydrodynamic module of C-GEM described the hydrodynamics of the 200 km long reach along Saigon River Estuary based on the continuity and cross-sectional integrated momentum equations. Water elevation at the estuary mouth and freshwater discharge at the upstream limit of the model domain was required to solve the hydrodynamics module. Parameters related to the characteristics of the tidal amplitude and period are also required to calculate the water elevation at the estuary mouth to constrain the downstream boundary.</p>

<p>Table <a href="#tab:CH2-table2-physical"><strong>??</strong></a> summarizes the parameters used to solve these hydrodynamics equations for the Saigon River Estuary. Chézy coefficient was the only parameter being fixed for the calibration of the hydrodynamic module, as it was not measured in the Saigon River Estuary. Chézy coefficient typically ranges from 40 – 60 <span class="math inline">\(m^{1/2}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(s^{-1}\)</span> along alluvial estuaries <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Savenije2001">H.

<p>After validating the hydrodynamics module, the transport module was implemented to reproduce the dynamics of dissolved variables (e.g., ammonium, dissolved oxygen) and total suspended sediment. The transport module was validated by comparing salinity simulation and observation during the dry season 2014 - 2017. Salinity was used because it is not affected by biogeochemical processes. In addition, salinity distributions reflect the combined processes such as advection-dispersion and mixing processes along Saigon River Estuary.

<p>In our simulations, seven of the eighteen biogeochemical parameters used by C-GEM were modified to suit the tropical conditions in the Saigon River Estuary (Table <a href="#tab:CH2-table3-parameters"><strong>??</strong></a>).

However, these parameters were in the ranges reported by <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Volta2016">Chiara Volta et al. 2016</a>)</span>.

<p>The TSS concentration has a direct impact on light extinction and then on phytoplankton development.
