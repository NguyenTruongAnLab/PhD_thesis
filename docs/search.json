Le manque de programmes de suivi et de modélisation n’pas permis de comprendre la dynamique des nutriments. Cette thèse vise à étudier la dynamique des nutriments dans un estuaire tropical sous l’influence d’une mégapole. Trois objectifs spécifiques sont () l’évaluation du fonctionnement biogéochimique d’un estuaire tropical urbanisé (estuaire de la rivière Saigon, Vietnam) recevant les eaux usées de la mégapole Ho Chi Minh (HCMC) ; (ii) la quantification du rôle des facteurs de contrôle (par exemple, les charges en nutriments, les taux de réaction, les conditions hydrologiques) dans le développement de l’eutrophisation ; (iii) l’évaluation du risque d’eutrophisation dans le cadre de scénarios d’urbanisation rapide et d’augmentation de la capacité de traitement des eaux usées.Le Carbon-Generic Estuarine Model (C-GEM), un modèle de transport réactif unidimensionnel, été appliqué après calibration avec les ensembles de données limités existant dans les pays en développement. Le fonctionnement biogéochimique été évalué en analysant les données de surveillance (physiochimie, structure et abondance du phytoplancton, et gaz à effet de serre) et complété par l’approche de modélisation. Le C-GEM été calibré et validé pour l’estuaire de la rivière Saigon en régime permanent pendant la saison sèche afin d’évaluer l’intensité des réactions biogéochimiques. Les dynamiques des nutriments, du phytoplancton, de l’eutrophisation ont été évaluées par la version transitoire du C-GEM pour 2017-2018. Des méthodes statistiques (par exemple, l’analyse en composantes principales, l’analyse de redondance et le partitionnement hiérarchique) ont été appliquées pour évaluer la contribution des paramètres environnementaux aux réponses du phytoplancton, de l’eutrophisation, des émissions de gaz à effet de serre. Enfin, des scénarios orientés vers le développement des mégapoles ont été évalués à l’aide de C-GEM pour évaluer le risque d’eutrophisation.Les résultats de cette thèse sont présentés respectivement en quatre parties. La première partie identifie l’impact des eaux usées domestiques de la mégapole sur les variations spatio-temporelles des nutriments, du phytoplancton, de l’eutrophisation et des gaz à effet de serre. Il n’y avait pas de différence statistiquement significative dans les concentrations de polluants nutritifs entre la saison sèche et la saison des pluies. Cependant, l’abondance du phytoplancton pendant la saison sèche est environ 100 fois supérieure à celle de la saison des pluies. Les concentrations élevées de carbone organique et de nutriments (azote et phosphore) ont entraîné un appauvrissement en oxygène et la formation d’un phytoplancton abondant dans la zone urbaine de l’estuaire. La deuxième partie explique le fonctionnement biogéochimique des estuaires tropicaux urbanisés à l’aide du modèle C-GEM (version en régime permanent). Les processus biogéochimiques clés (.e., la nitrification, la dénitrification, la production primaire) sont quantifiés. Cet estuaire élimine efficacement l’azote grâce aux forts processus de nitrification et de dénitrification. La troisième partie étudie la variation saisonnière des nutriments et du phytoplancton sous les fortes fluctuations des conditions hydrologiques des estuaires tropicaux. Le temps de résidence est l’un des plus importants facteurs de contrôle de la biomasse phytoplanctonique. Enfin, les résultats de l’évaluation du risque d’eutrophisation basée sur le développement des mégapoles montrent qu’une augmentation du nombre de STEP ne garantit toujours pas de bonnes conditions de qualité de l’eau de l’estuaire.L’application du modèle C-GEM avec une source de données minimale met en évidence les processus biogéochimiques et les facteurs hydrologiques dans la dynamique des nutriments et de l’eutrophisation dans les estuaires tropicaux urbanisés. Ainsi, cette étude fournit un support efficace pour une meilleure gestion des risques d’eutrophisation pour les pays en développement.Mots-clés: modélisation biogéochimique; mégapole; phytoplancton; Vietnam; estuaires tropicaux.","code":""},{"path":"index.html","id":"acknowledgments","chapter":"Welcome","heading":"Acknowledgments","text":"still rush finish thesis, believe need calm write first sentences thesis started three years ago. feel happy remember good memories helped finish thesis. sincerely thank supervisors, gave autonomy thesis trust completely.

Temperature tidal effects also cause phytoplankton fluctuations estuarine systems (Bianchi 2007). Several studies suggest residence time key factor directly affects density phytoplankton (Lancelot Muylaert 2011). estuaries long residence time weak flushing capacity, phytoplankton enough time grow flushed system. contrast, estuaries short residence strong flushing capacity, phytoplankton often pushed system rapidly growing even high nutrient concentration. Indeed, phytoplankton densities increase net specific growth rates exceed residence time water (Miguel, Lucas Lavo António Jimo 2018). tropical estuaries, causes leading differences eutrophication estuaries often stem fluctuations hydrology weather conditions (Damar et al. 2019; Buranapratheprat et al. 2021).

However, studies reported residence times greatly affect phytoplankton densities species, rather light penetration intensity influenced suspended sediments nutrient availability (Hoang et al. 2018). upstream estuaries, light availability generally better downstream shallow water active sediment resuspension mouth estuaries.
