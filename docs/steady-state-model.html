<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Estuaries are amongst the most productive ecosystems of the land ocean continuum, but they are also under high anthropic pressures due to coastal urbanization. Too sparse observations have hindered the understanding of complex interactions between water quality and estuarine hydrodynamics and biogeochemical transformations. Until now, estuarine modelling studies have mainly focused on temperate estuarine systems in industrialized countries. This study investigates the responses of a tropical estuary to pollution load from a megacity (Ho Chi Minh City, Southern Vietnam) by applying a one-dimensional, biogeochemical estuarine model (C-GEM). The Saigon River Estuary flows through the megacity of Ho Chi Minh (HCMC) and is subject to episodic hypoxia events due to wastewater inputs from urban discharges. Good agreements are found between simulation outputs and observations for tidal propagation, salinity, total suspended sediment, and water quality variables in dry season in the Saigon River Estuary. C-GEM reproduces the increases in ammonium, total organic carbon, phytoplankton and dissolved oxygen depletion in the urban section of the Saigon River as an impact of untreated wastewaters from HCMC. The steady-state version of C-GEM also reveals the formation of a pollutant cloud (30-km stretch) resulting from the combined effects of tidal fluctuation and low flushing capacity during the dry season. Furthermore, the quantification of the reaction fluxes simulated by the model demonstrates that nitrification is the main process removing <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> from the Saigon River. For the first time in such a type of environment, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of C-GEM at unraveling the complex interplay between biogeochemical reactions and transport in a tropical estuary with a minimized data requirement. This is significant for tropical estuaries in developing countries, where intensive monitoring programs are rare and have thus been rarely the object of modeling investigations.</p>

<p>Estuaries are complex ecosystems under the simultaneous influences of tides and rivers, where nutrient loads are controlled by urban, industrial, and agricultural emissions. Although estuaries have selfâpurification capacity supported by the tidal mixing of inland and coastal waters, excessive nutrients loads are likely to cause eutrophication <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Lanoux2013">Lanoux et al. 2013</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Paerl2006">Paerl 2006</a>)</span>. This phenomenon threatens water resources safety, especially for megacities in developing countries, where the balance between urbanization and environmental management is commonly a difficult tradeoff. In this context, reactive transport models can provide valuable insight to better understand the complex biogeochemical dynamics of such estuaries and help predict the potential response of water quality to anthropic perturbations. Under the pressure of multiple pollution sources (e.g., domestic wastewater, industrials inputs), the main factors controlling water quality in estuaries are biological and physical processes; in particular: (1) biogeochemical processes such as nitrification, denitrification, remineralization, primary production in water columns <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Hu2009">J. Hu and Li 2009</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Vanderborght2007">Vanderborght et al. 2007</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Volta2016">Chiara Volta et al. 2016</a>)</span> as well as adsorption-desorption processes at the water-sediment interface <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Mortimer1999">Mortimer et al. 1999</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Nemery2007">NÃ©mery and Garnier 2007</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Vilmin2015">Vilmin et al. 2015</a>)</span>; (2) dilution process between riverine and marine waters <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Etcheber2011">Etcheber et al. 2011</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-LajaunieSalla2019">Lajaunie-Salla et al. 2019</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Lanoux2013">Lanoux et al. 2013</a>)</span>. Understanding these processes is often facilitated by using numerical models that usually require high-frequency data series (Tappin, 2002; Wild-Allen and Rayner, 2014).</p>
<p>Studies on the anthropogenic impact on water quality in estuaries by biogeochemical models are mainly available in temperate estuaries of industrialized countries <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Gawade2017">Gawade et al. 2017</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Regnier2013">Pierre Regnier et al. 2013</a>)</span>.The Carbon Generic Estuarine Model (C-GEM) is a generic one-dimensional, reaction-transport model that takes advantage of the relationship between estuarine geometry and hydrodynamics to minimize data requirements <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Volta2014">C. Volta et al. 2014</a>)</span>. Steady-state simulations of C-GEM have provided accurate descriptions of estuarine hydrodynamics and biogeochemical transformations in several temperate estuaries <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Laruelle2017">G. Laruelle et al. 2017</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-Laruelle2017">2017</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Volta2014">C. Volta et al. 2014</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Volta2016">Chiara Volta et al. 2016</a>)</span>. The biogeochemical reaction network of C-GEM and its parameterization were built upon the study of more than 40 temperate estuaries <span class="citation">C. Volta et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Volta2014">2014</a>)</span>; <span class="citation">Chiara Volta et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Volta2016">2016</a>)</span>. Although several studies have been carried out in tropical estuaries through monitoring and experiments (e.g. <span class="citation">Miguel, Lucas Lavo AntÃ³nio Jimo (<a href="references.html#ref-MiguelLucasLavoAntonioJimo2018">2018</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Vipindas et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Vipindas2018">2018</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">J. Wu et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Wu2013">2013</a>)</span>), estuarine biogeochemical modelling applications are still missing in many countries in tropical regions such as Southeast Asia, India, Africa, South and Central America <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Volta2016">Chiara Volta et al. 2016</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Regnier2013">Pierre Regnier et al. 2013</a>)</span>. There is now a need to improve this temperate parameterization of C-GEM to allow for the robust simulation of tropical estuaries. This is of particular importance for water resource management in urbanized tropical estuaries such as in the Saigon River Estuary, Vietnam <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2019">T. T. N. Nguyen, NÃ©mery, Gratiot, Strady, et al. 2019</a>)</span>, Recife estuarine system, Brazil <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Noriega2013">Noriega, Araujo, and LefÃ¨vre 2013</a>)</span>; Cochin Estuary, India <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Gupta2009">Gupta et al. 2009</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Vipindas2018">Vipindas et al. 2018</a>)</span>; Cross River estuary system, Nigeria <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Dan2019">Dan et al. 2019</a>)</span>; Cisadane estuary, Indonesia <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Dong2011">Dong et al. 2011</a>)</span>. The most notable difference between temperate and tropical systems is the rate of biological processes. The higher temperature of tropical estuaries often increases the biological uptake, excretion of nutrients and microbial activity (e.g., nitrification and denitrification) <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Eyre1999">B. Eyre and Balls 1999</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Tappin2002">Tappin 2002</a>)</span>. Another major difference between the two types of estuaries is the flow regime with a direct impact on the retention time of water bodies. In most tropical estuaries, two distinct flow rates and retention time are found during the dry and rainy seasons <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Dong2011">Dong et al. 2011</a>)</span>, whereas higher flow rates occur in winter in temperate estuaries. <span class="citation">Vipindas et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Vipindas2018">2018</a>)</span> suggested that nitrification rate can increase 10-40 folds when encountering a low flushing rate of tropical estuary during pre-monsoon. Similarly, oxidation rate of organic matter would not be significantly affected by temperature, but by the river discharge magnitude <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Gawade2017">Gawade et al. 2017</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Wu2013b">Y. Wu et al. 2013</a>)</span> . Therefore, the factors controlling the intensity of biogeochemical processes will differ between the temperate and tropical systems.</p>
<p>The Saigon River Estuary (Southern Vietnam) is a tropical estuary located in Southeast Asia. This estuary is considered as a natural collector for domestic wastewaters of about 9 million people living in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). Urban canals of HCMC and the Saigon River receive about 90% of untreated domestic wastewater from HCMC <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2020">T. T. N. Nguyen et al. 2020</a>)</span>. The high polluted loads regularly lead to an excess of nutrients and intense periods of anoxia, especially during the dry season <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2019">T. T. N. Nguyen, NÃ©mery, Gratiot, Strady, et al. 2019</a>)</span>. There have been several studies in recent years showing the risk of eutrophication in this estuary, especially in the dry season because of low flushing capacity <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2019">T. T. N. Nguyen, NÃ©mery, Gratiot, Strady, et al. 2019</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Camenen2021">Camenen et al. 2021</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2021">A. T. Nguyen et al. 2021</a>)</span>. In addition, the research results of <span class="citation">T. T. N. Nguyen, NÃ©mery, Gratiot, Strady, et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2019">2019</a>)</span> showed that there was no significant difference between water quality variables in rainy season and dry season (except chlorophyll <em>a</em>). Besides that, the phytoplankton abundances were very low in rainy season, but more than 100 times higher in dry season which mainly concentrated in urban section of Saigon River <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2021b">An Truong Nguyen et al. 2021</a>)</span>. Simultaneously, the risk of estuarine pollution is expected to increase in the coming years, under the impact of megacityâs development. The population of HCMC is indeed expected to reach 23 million by 2050, the Saigon River would then receive three times more pollution than what is currently released by the city <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2020">T. T. N. Nguyen et al. 2020</a>)</span>. Understanding the self-purification capacity of this tropical estuary is important for HCMCâs development plans related to water resources safety.</p>
<p>This study aims to quantify the biogeochemical processes and tidal fluctuations controlling the water quality in a tropical estuary. We applied C-GEM to simulate the evolution of water quality over a tidal cycle representative of the dry season in the Saigon River Estuary during the 2014 â 2017 period, as a representative case study of an urban impacted tropical estuary. In the first part of the paper, the characteristics of the study area are described, including those of the estuary (Saigon River Estuary) and of the megacity (Ho Chi Minh City). The second part of the paper presents the protocol for implementing C-GEM model in this tropical estuary, in terms of description of data collection, the model constraints, the fundamental equations for building hydrodynamics, transport modules, biogeochemical reactions, and associated parameters that need to be calibrated. The last part of the paper deals with the quantification of interactions between estuaries and water quality including tidal effects and biogeochemical transformations. Intensity of biogeochemical reactions and fluxes are also calculated and compared with other studies in temperate and tropical estuaries.</p>

<p>The Saigon River Estuary system is located in Southern Vietnam. The river flows from its source in southeastern Cambodia to the Dau Tieng Reservoir in Vietnam. Dau Tieng Reservoir (270 <span class="math inline">\(km^{2}\)</span> and 1580x106 <span class="math inline">\(m^{3}\)</span>) was designed for ï¬ood control, domestic and industrial water demands and preventing the saltwater intrusion in the Saigon River <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Ngoc2014">Trieu, Hiramatsu, and Harada 2014</a>)</span>. The Saigon River then flows through the natural boundaries of Tay Ninh province, Binh Duong province and Ho Chi Minh City. From Dau Tieng Reservoir to the estuary mouth, 200 km downstream, the Saigon River (18 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 14 <span class="math inline">\(m^{3}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(s^{-1}\)</span>) joins in turn several notable tributaries such as the Thi Tinh River (20 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 11 <span class="math inline">\(m^{3}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(s^{-1}\)</span>) and the Dongnai River (632 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 446 <span class="math inline">\(m^{3}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(s^{-1}\)</span>), forming Nha Be River, which then splits into two river mouths (Soai Rap River and Long Tau River) flowing into the East Sea of Vietnam (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-Map-Model">4.1</a>). In addition, the Saigon River is connected to an urban river (Vam Thuat River, 4 <span class="math inline">\(m^{3}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(s^{-1}\)</span>) and three urban canals of HCMC (combined discharge of 5.5 <span class="math inline">\(m^{3}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(s^{-1}\)</span>) before the confluence with Dongnai River <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2020">T. T. N. Nguyen et al. 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The climate of this estuarine area is tropical monsoon, which has two distinct seasons (dry and rainy season), with a relatively constant temperature (about 29oC). The rainy season lasts from May to November, with an average annual rainfall of 1800 mm <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2019">T. T. N. Nguyen, NÃ©mery, Gratiot, Strady, et al. 2019</a>)</span>. Under the semi-diurnal tidal mixing, the saline intrusion diffuses up to 90 km upstream <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Aygun2019">Aygun, Jonoski, and Popescu 2019</a>)</span>. The tidal amplitude ranges from 1m during neap tide to about 4m during spring tide <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Schwarzer2016">Schwarzer, Thanh, and Ricklefs 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Land use in the watershed of the Saigon River significantly varies from North to South. Upstream of HCMC (North of the city), agricultural activities dominate with paddy rice and rubber tree farms. The central area hosts urban settlements and industrial zones belonging to HCMC. Downstream of the estuary, the Can Gio mangrove system is recognized as a biosphere reserve by UNESCO.</p>
<p>The status of water quality in the Saigon River strongly varies along its path. The water quality status at the upstream and downstream ends of the estuary are considered good, based on Vietnamese regulation on surface water quality <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2019">T. T. N. Nguyen, NÃ©mery, Gratiot, Strady, et al. 2019</a>)</span>. The water quality status of Saigon River becomes moderate to bad condition after connecting with the Vam Thuat River (an urban river, km 114) and urban canals of HCMC (km 130, <span class="citation">T. T. N. Nguyen et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2020">2020</a>)</span>). While nitrate (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_3^{-}}\)</span>) concentrations in canals are similar or lower than in the upstream stretch of Saigon River <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Strady2017">Strady et al. 2017</a>)</span>, the ammonium (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span>) and total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations in those canals are many times higher than the threshold of 0.3 mg <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>, 4 mg TOC <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> provided by the Vietnamese regulation for surface water â QCVN 08:2015/BTNMT <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2020">T. T. N. Nguyen et al. 2020</a>)</span>. However, the concentration of these pollutants at the outlet of the canals decreases several folds before entering the Saigon River supported by three factors: firstly, the high retention and removal capacity of urban rivers and canals of HCMC, secondly, the mud dredging activities and finally, the dilution effect during flood tide <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2020">T. T. N. Nguyen et al. 2020</a>)</span>. In the downstream section, the water quality of Saigon River Estuary improves markedly after joining the Dongnai River.</p>

<p>Bathymetry, freshwater inflow, water level, water quality and climate conditions were collected to implement C-CEM.</p>
<p>Mean depth and width for 83 cross-sections along the 200 km long Saigon River Estuary were extracted from bathymetry surveys performed in 2008 and 2016, provided by the Southern Institute of Water Resources Research (SIWRR, Vietnam). Climate condition data (sunshine hours and wind speed) were obtained from the statistical office of HCMC (www.pso.hochiminhcity.gov.vn).</p>

<p>Water quality data were obtained from the Center of Environment Monitoring (CEM, Vietnam) and the Centre Asiatique de Recherche sur lâEau (CARE, Vietnam). CEM has monitored the water quality in the Saigon River Estuary (bi-weekly) and urban canals of HCMC (monthly) since 2005. The measured variables include temperature (ToC), salinity, total suspended sediment (TSS), dissolved oxygen (DO), ammonium (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span>), phosphate (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span>), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{BOD_5}\)</span>). The CARE laboratory has observed water quality at three locations along the Saigon River and one in the Dongnai River since July 2015 (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-Map-Model">4.1</a>). These locations are the same as those used by the CEM monitoring program, but CAREâs analyses include additional variables such as total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), nitrate (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_3^{-}}\)</span>), total organic carbon (TOC), dissolved silica (DSi) and chlorophyll-a as described in <span class="citation">T. T. N. Nguyen, NÃ©mery, Gratiot, Strady, et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2019">2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Hydrological data (water level, velocity, discharge) were measured monthly at 10 stations along the Saigon and Dongnai rivers by the CEM. Once a month, the hydrological monitoring stations track the evolution of water level and velocity over 24 hours (2 tidal cycles) to calculate the net water discharge by removing the influence of tidal fluctuations in the Saigon River Estuary <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Camenen2021">Camenen et al. 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Implementing a water quality model for the assessment of daily to seasonal fluctuations in river flow was limited by the low frequency of hydrological measurements. The simulation of water quality for conditions representative of an average dry season is therefore a reasonable choice for our study. During the dry season, the upstream flow discharge is low and quite steady <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Camenen2021">Camenen et al. 2021</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2020">T. T. N. Nguyen et al. 2020</a>)</span>. In contrast, a lack of high-resolution data for precipitation, runoff and river discharge during the rainy season would have resulted in reliability issues of the modeling, especially in developing countries such as in Southeast Asia with a low monitoring effort. Besides, the high flow in the rainy season can create very short residence times and high flushing capacity, pollutants thus being mainly washed away from the estuary towards coastal waters.</p>

<p>The generic estuarine model C-GEM was applied in the Saigon River Estuary to reproduce the nutrient dynamics over a generic tidal cycle representative of dry season conditions. The version of C-GEM used in this study was built upon the steady-state version described in <span class="citation">Chiara Volta et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Volta2016">2016</a>)</span> with some parameter values adjusted for tropical monsoon conditions in the Saigon River Estuary. The updated values of the modified parameters (discussed below) fall within the ranges provided by <span class="citation">Chiara Volta et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Volta2016">2016</a>)</span> based on a literature survey.</p>
<p>C-GEMâs application domain spans 200 km of the Saigon River Estuary, from the outlet of Dau Tieng Reservoir (km 0) to the estuary mouth (km 200) (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-Map-Model">4.1</a>). The three main modules of C-GEM (geometry module, hydrodynamics â transport module and biogeochemical module) were implemented following the set-up protocol proposed by <span class="citation">C. Volta et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Volta2014">2014</a>)</span>. The partial differential equations governing the hydrodynamics module were solved using a finite difference scheme applied along a 1D grid, with a grid size of 2000 m and an integration time step of 300 seconds, insuring the stability of the numerical scheme. A operator-splitting method was used to solve the transport and biogeochemical reactions within a single time step <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Regnier1997">P. Regnier, Wollast, and Steefel 1997</a>)</span>. C-GEM required a spin-up of 180 days to get into a steady-state regime for the Saigon River Estuary. A dynamic steady state was considered reached once two consecutive tidal cycles generated similar hydrological and biogeochemical results that could then be compared with observations.</p>

<p>Following Savenijeâs work on alluvial estuaries <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Savenije2005">Hubert H. G. Savenije 2005</a>)</span>, C-GEM uses an idealized representation of the estuarine geometry which can describe the estuarine width by an exponential equation along the estuary gradient.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\bar{B}\left(x\right)=B_0\cdot\exp{\left(-\frac{x}{b}\right)}\]</span></p>
<p>where x is the distance from estuary mouth [m], B0 is the width at estuary mouth [m], b is the width convergence length [m].</p>

<p>C-GEM was designed to account for the interdependency between geometry and hydrodynamics in tidal alluvial estuaries. The width convergence length, which controls the systemâs shape, is thus a very sensitive parameter for hydrodynamics. Therefore, the value of the convergence length was carefully calibrated against observations (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-Model-Depth">4.2</a>). The impact of freshwater flow on this estuarine morphology was very different between the upstream (before Dongnai River confluence) and downstream sections <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Gugliotta2020">Gugliotta et al. 2020</a>)</span>. The estuarine width ranges from 60 m from Dau Tieng Reservoir (km 0) to 350 m (km 140), and rapidly increases to 3690 m at the estuary mouth. This particular geometry justifies the use of a second convergence length to reproduce the entire width profile of the Saigon River Estuary. C-GEM geometry used a short convergence length from the estuary mouth (km 200) to the confluence of the Saigon and Dongnai rivers (km 142). From this confluence to the upstream section (km 142 â km 0), the width of the river only decreases slowly and gradually (with longer convergence length) (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-Model-Depth">4.2</a> and Table <a href="#tab:C4-table2-physical"><strong>??</strong></a>). Such strategy was previously used with C-GEM for applications to other estuaries <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Laruelle2019">Goulven G. Laruelle et al. 2019</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Volta2016b">C. Volta, Laruelle, and Regnier 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The depth of the Saigon River Estuary gradually increases from 2.5 m at the outlet of Dau Tieng reservoir to 19 m at km 60. The depth of the river is then almost constant over the next 80 km (i.e.Â until the confluence with the Dongnai River), it then decreases gradually to 9.6 m at the estuary mouth. The idealized geometry in the model captured well the mean estuarine depth and width which were extracted from 83 cross-sections of the bathymetry.</p>

<p>Water elevation at estuary mouth and freshwater discharge at the upstream limit of the model domain were required to solve the hydrodynamics module. Parameters related to the characteristics of the tidal amplitude and period are also required to calculate the water elevation at the estuary mouth to constrain the downstream boundary. Table <a href="#tab:C4-table2-physical"><strong>??</strong></a> summarizes the parameters used to solve these equations for the Saigon River Estuary. ChÃ©zy coefficient was the only parameter being fixed for the calibration of the hydrodynamic module, as it was not measured in the Saigon River Estuary. ChÃ©zy coefficient typically ranges from 40 â 60 <span class="math inline">\(m^{1/2}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(s^{-1}\)</span> along alluvial estuaries <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Savenije2001">H.

The ChÃ©zy coefficient was calibrated based on the comparison between simulated tidal amplitude profiles and mean tidal observations at seven stations along Saigon River Estuary. Calibrated results showed that the ChÃ©zy coefficient applied Saigon Estuary ranged from 15 to 60 <span class="math inline">\(m^{1/2}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(s^{-1}\)</span>. The upper reaches of the Saigon River were much rougher than other alluvial estuaries.

<p>The transport module was validated by comparing salinity simulation and observation during the dry season 2014 - 2017. Salinity was used because it is not affected by biogeochemical processes (variable P = 0). In addition, salinity distributions reflect the combined processes such as advection-dispersion and mixing processes along Saigon River Estuary. Salinity simulation results for the 2014-2017 dry season in the Saigon River are depicted in Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-Model-range">4.3</a>.

<p>The biogeochemical module implemented in C-GEM in this study allows assessing the concentrations of eight state variables, namely ammonium (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span>), nitrate (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_3^{-}}\)</span>), phosphate (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span>), total organic carbon (TOC), Silica (DSi), dissolved oxygen (DO), phytoplankton (diatoms and non-diatoms) and TSS. Seven biogeochemical processes are simulated in C-GEM (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-C-GEM">4.4</a>), including oxygen exchange through the air-water interface, aerobic degradation (organic carbon mineralization), nitrification, denitrification, primary production, phytoplankton mortality and TSS erosion/deposition <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Volta2014">C.

<p>C-GEM uses eighteen biogeochemical parameters to calculate the intensity of biogeochemical processes. Their determination is based on a comprehensive literature review of 49 estuarine biogeochemical model applications in temperate regions <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Volta2016">Chiara Volta et al. 2016</a>)</span>. The primary production process corresponds to the growth of phytoplankton and oxygen production through the uptake of C, N, P, and Si in the water column under soluble form depending on environmental forcings, especially light penetration. The light availability in the water column is affected by TSS, which is calculated by the model through the simulation of erosion/deposition processes. Nitrification consumes DO in the water column, which potentially eliminates a high concentration of ammonium. Denitrification contributes to anaerobic TOC consumption, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> production and nitrogen elimination by converting <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_3^{-}}\)</span> into the inert <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2}\)</span>gas that escapes from the water column into the atmosphere. Mineralization of organic matter (aerobic degradation) consumes TOC and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{O_{2}}\)</span> while producing <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span>. Currently the application of C-GEM to shallow, pristine estuarine systems might be critical, when processes are dominated by intense element recycling within the sediments. The current lack of some N processes such as anammox does likely not significantly alter our result because these processes are relatively minor contributors to the nitrogen cycle in tropical estuaries <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Dong2011">Dong et al. 2011</a>)</span>. However, the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_3^{-}}\)</span> simulation might affected by dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium process in tropical estuaries with low <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_3^{-}}\)</span> concentration <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Dong2011">Dong et al. 2011</a>)</span>. Phosphate release from bottom sediment might have a high impact on the phosphorus simulation at shallow estuaries <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Vilmin2015">Vilmin et al. 2015</a>)</span>. Note that the modular structure of C-GEM allows for a relatively simple implementation of new processes in its biogeochemical module and increasing the complexity of the N and P cycles could be the subject of future studies.</p>
<p>In our simulations, seven of the eighteen biogeochemical parameters used by C-GEM were modified to suit the tropical conditions in the Saigon River Estuary (Table <a href="#tab:C4-table3-sediment"><strong>??</strong></a>). These reaction rate constants (except aerobic degradation rate constant) are mostly higher than the C-GEM applications for temperate estuaries. In particular, nitrification, denitrification rate constants are 2-12 times higher. However, these parameters were in the ranges reported by <span class="citation">C. Volta, Laruelle, and Regnier (<a href="references.html#ref-Volta2016b">2016</a>)</span>. In addition, they are similar to findings of biogeochemical reactions in tropical estuaries reported by <span class="citation">Miranda et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Miranda2008">2008</a>)</span> or <span class="citation">Vipindas et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Vipindas2018">2018</a>)</span>. The eleven other biogeochemical parameters were similar, including phytoplankton maintenance rate constant (4.11 x 10-7 <span class="math inline">\(s^{-1}\)</span>), phytoplankton excretion constant (0.05), phytoplankton growth constant (0.29), Redfield ratio (C:Si:N:P = 106:15:16:1), Michaelis â Menten constant terms for dissolved silica (1.07), phosphate (0.2), ammonium (228.9), nitrate (26.07), organic carbon (186.25), oxygen in aerobic degradation (31.0), oxygen in nitrification (51.25), dissolved nitrogen (1.13).</p>
<p>The TSS concentration has a direct impact on light extinction and then on phytoplankton development. The sediment parameters (critical shear stress and erosion coefficient) were thus determined before adjusting biological ones though a calibration process only involving hydrological parameters and SPM concentration profiles.</p>

<p>Simulations using the hydrodynamics and transport modules were only evaluated using average tidal amplitude and salinity profiles collected during the average dry season from 2014 to 2017 (Figure 4).

<p>Our results reveal that the model properly reproduces concentrations and spatial trends for most of the biogeochemical state variables over the generic tidal cycles in the dry season. The simulations of TSS, DO, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span>, TOC reveal a pretty good agreement with observations based on model performance statistics (Table <a href="#tab:C4-table6-perform"><strong>??</strong></a>) with <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{R^2}\)</span>&gt; 0.7 and percent bias &lt; 20%. <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_3^{-}}\)</span> and DSi also fall within the range of observations at three sampling stations along the Saigon River. Phytoplankton is rather well represented by the model despite a high pbias of 178% (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-Model-quality">4.5</a>f). <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> is the only variable not properly captured by C-GEM (pbias = 39%), but the simulated profiles still remain well within the standard deviations of the observations (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-Model-quality">4.5</a>e).</p>
<p>In the upstream section of the estuary (km 0 to 60-80), most variables are low and almost constant, except DO and DSi (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-Model-quality">4.5</a>). Water quality in this area is highly dependent on water discharge from Dau Tieng Reservoir which is rated in good status according to Vietnamese regulation on surface water quality (QCVN 08: 2015/BTNMT) <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2019">T. T. N. Nguyen, NÃ©mery, Gratiot, Strady, et al. 2019</a>)</span>. The sudden increase in DSi concentration from km 60 to 80 originates from the higher DSi concentration of TT river tributary (Table <a href="#tab:C4-table4-BC"><strong>??</strong></a>). The simulation overestimates <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> concentration and underestimates TOC concentration. The underestimation of TOC may first stem from the intensity of the TOC degradation process, but also from TOC inputs to the system which may not be well considered. <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> overestimation can be explained by the lack of an important process in C-GEM, such as adsorption within the water column or in the sediment because the current version of the model does not have an explicit benthic module. This assumption is consistent with the study of <span class="citation">Vilmin et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Vilmin2015">2015</a>)</span> who confirmed that the concentration of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> in estuaries is very sensitive to the adsorption of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> onto the surface sediment. The concentration of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> can indeed be reduced by 50% in the presence of adsorption in estuaries <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Vilmin2015">Vilmin et al. 2015</a>)</span>. Using a modelling approach, <span class="citation">J. Hu and Li (<a href="references.html#ref-Hu2009">2009</a>)</span> indicated that <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> adsorption can account for about 99% of total <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> removal in the Pearl River, a subtropical estuary in China. <span class="citation">T. T. N. Nguyen, NÃ©mery, Gratiot, Strady, et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2019">2019</a>)</span> also reported that the Saigon River exhibits a high potential of phosphate adsorption onto the sediments ranging from 1 to 64%. However, the current water quality monitoring programs in the Saigon River (by CEM and CARE laboratory) mainly analyze <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span>, without measuring particulate inorganic phosphorus (PIP) in routine. <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> and PIP are indeed two necessary indicators for building the representation of sorption processes <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Billen2007">G. Billen et al. 2007</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Vilmin2015">Vilmin et al. 2015</a>)</span>. The addition of PIP measurements in future monitoring programs can thus support the improvement of C-GEM.</p>
<p>In the urban section (km 80 to 140), the Saigon River Estuaryâs water quality, which receives domestic wastewater through the connected urban canals of HCMC, was clearly different from the upstream section. The concentrations of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> and TOC in the canal were much higher than in the upstream area <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2020">T.

The model successfully simulates DO, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_3^{-}}\)</span>, TOC, DSi and phytoplankton concentrations in this section.

The <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_3^{-}}\)</span> concentrations from urban canals are not significantly different from the upstream concentration (~0.4 mg <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>), and the contribution of the urban VT river was fixed to 0.71 mg <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> (Table <a href="#tab:C4-table4-BC"><strong>??</strong></a>). The increase in <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_3^{-}}\)</span> in this urban section reaching more than 1 mg <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> would be thus linked to biogeochemical processes in the water column rather than the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_3^{-}}\)</span> anthropogenic contribution. In our simulations, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> concentrations are overestimated (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-Model-quality">4.5</a>f) which could likely be attributed to an inefficient <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> uptake by the phytoplankton to compensate the higher load of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> brought by the urban VT river and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> production from aerobic degradation and denitrification processes. The decrease of DSi and increase of phytoplankton biomass were well simulated in this section and can be attributed to diatom growth. The abrupt decrease in phytoplankton and a slight increase in DSi between km 130 and 140 (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-Model-quality">4.5</a>f,h) corresponds to a dilution effect resulting from the mixing with the Dongnai River.</p>
<p>Downstream of the confluence with the Dongnai River (km 140-160 to 200), the concentrations of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span>, TOC, phytoplankton and DSi gradually decreased towards the estuary mouth (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-Model-quality">4.5</a>). Most of the variables in this area meet the Vietnamese regulation QCVN 08: 2015/BTNMT on surface water quality for domestic use and aquatic life. The water quality in the downstream section of Saigon River Estuary largely depends on the Dongnai River confluenceâs water quality, its discharge being about 10 times larger than that of Saigon River (392.9 <span class="math inline">\(m^{3}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(s^{-1}\)</span> against 17.6 <span class="math inline">\(m^{3}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(s^{-1}\)</span>). Therefore, the concentrations of the simulated variables at this confluence (km 140) are almost similar to those from the Dongnai tributary, except TSS that increases from 100 to 180 mg <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> from km 140 to km 180, in dry season (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-Model-quality">4.5</a>g). This increase in TSS concentration is not caused by the Dongnai River, but instead by sediment erosion and resuspension (see section 3.3). Further, the gradually decreasing concentration of TSS from the 180 km to the estuary mouth is due to the dilution with coastal water.</p>

<p>Saigon River Estuary is dominated by a semi-diurnal tidal regime from the East Vietnam Sea which changes four times a day. Sea water can penetrate inland to more than 120 km during the dry season. Although tides can improve water quality through the mixing of urban and saline waters, the tidal fluctuation jointly diffuses the highly polluted sources into a pollutant cloud along the estuary.</p>
<p>Our simulation over 24-hours (two tidal cycles) shows that there a pollutant cloud of about 30 km remains centered around kilometer 120 regardless of the time of day with low DO (&lt; 2 mg<span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>) (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-tide">4.6</a>a). At 0h (in a generic day), the contaminated area is located from km 108 to km 138, while it roughly expends from kilometers 98 to 128 after six hours (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-tide">4.6</a>a). These upstream and downstream movements are controlled by the flood and ebb tides in the Saigon River Estuary. During the dry season, tidal oscillation dominates because the freshwater discharge from upstream the river is very small (few tens of <span class="math inline">\(m^{3}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(s^{-1}\)</span>). From the outlet of the urban discharge (km 114) to the confluence with the Dongnai River (140 km), the residual discharge at the Saigon River is about 30 <span class="math inline">\(m^{3}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(s^{-1}\)</span> during the dry season. A rough estimate of the residual velocity for a segment of 26 km (km 114 to 140 km) using an average cross-section of 5700 <span class="math inline">\(m^{2}\)</span> (width x depth: 300m x 19m) yields a value of 0.45 km <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span>.</p>

<p>As a result of our simulations, a water particle could travel a distance of 10 km over six hours during flood tide (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-tide">4.6</a>b). It would then almost return to its original position after six hours of receding tide. The maximum tidal velocity at km 108 could reach 0.8 m <span class="math inline">\(s^{-1}\)</span> during flooding tide. The residence time of the water body in this urban section was thus estimated to be around 57 days. Low discharge not only makes pollutants unable to flush out during the dry season, but it also increases the risk of eutrophication. The long residence times of water with high concentrations of nutrients facilitate algaeâs growth in this section before being flushed out of the estuary. As mentioned previously by <span class="citation">T. T. N. Nguyen, NÃ©mery, Gratiot, Strady, et al.

<p>While tidal mixing is the main control of the modelâs state variables concentrations in the downstream section of the estuary, the biogeochemical processes play a much larger role in regulating the biogeochemical dynamics of the system in its upstream and urban sections, especially in the pollutant cloud (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-process">4.7</a>). Once evaluated, C-GEM allows to quantify the intensity of each process controlling the consumption or production of oxygen, nutrients, and organic carbon along the estuary, together with the physical processes such as erosion/deposition of TSS and oxygen exchange. In general, the Saigon River Estuary tends to (i) consume <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{O_{2}}\)</span> in the urban section and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span>, DSi, TOC in the entire estuary; (ii) produce DO in the upstream and downstream sections, TSS in both urban and downstream sections and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_3^{-}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> and phytoplankton in the whole estuary.</p>

<p>Oxygen exchange (between surface water and atmosphere) and net primary production (NPP) are the two processes that provide oxygen to the estuary in C-GEM. The oxygen exchange at the air-water interface strongly contributes to the oxygenation of the water column in the Saigon River Estuary while most of other processes (except for NPP) consume oxygen. From upstream to downstream of the Saigon River, the oxygen exchange produces between 4.0 and 8.3 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>M <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{O_{2}}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span> (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-process">4.7</a>a). This amount of oxygen introduces into the water through the air-water interface is quite similar to the amount of oxygen consumed by TOC aerobic degradation. Consumption of oxygen by nitrification process appears slightly smaller in the upstream and downstream sections, but significantly increases in the urban sector. Oxygen production by phytoplankton also increases in the urban section but remains negligible in the upstream and downstream sections compared to the other oxygen production/consumption processes.</p>

<p>Nitrification primarily leads to DO depletion and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> consumption in the Saigon River. The nitrification process is particularly intense in the urban section (from km 98 to km 138). Nitrification could convert a maximum of 9.3 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>M N <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_3^{-}}\)</span> at km 130 (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-process">4.7</a>c, d). In the urban section, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> consumption by nitrification surpasses the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> production by TOC degradation. This contributes to explain the decrease of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> upstream and downstream of the Saigon River. The simulated nitrification rate in the Saigon River is similar to observations at Kochi estuary (0 - 4 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>M N <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span>), a tropical monsoon estuary in India which receives untreated sewage from urban activities <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Miranda2008">Miranda et al. 2008</a>)</span>. Further, in another study in the Cochin estuary (southeast Arabian Sea), <span class="citation">Vipindas et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Vipindas2018">2018</a>)</span> observed particularly high nitrification rates in the dry season (about 10 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>M N <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span>) because of the low flushing rate of the estuary, a situation also met in the Saigon estuary.</p>
<p>Denitrification is a process controlling the concentration of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_3^{-}}\)</span> by transforming <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_3^{-}}\)</span> into atmospheric gaseous <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2}\)</span> (and possibly <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span>, as an intermediate product, although this step is not explicitly modelled by C-GEM) under anoxic conditions. In addition, denitrification forms <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> under anoxic conditions <span class="citation">Sandra Arndt et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Arndt2011">2011</a>)</span> which partly explains the increase of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> in the urban section of the Saigon River. Besides, under anoxic condition, a possible release of bottom <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> through sediment desorption might occur <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nemery2007">NÃ©mery and Garnier 2007</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Vilmin2015">Vilmin et al. 2015</a>)</span>. The simulated denitrification rate in the Saigon River reached a maximum of 3.3 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>M N <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span> in the urban section. The intensity of the removal of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_3^{-}}\)</span> through denitrification is only one-third of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_3^{-}}\)</span> formation through nitrification (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-process">4.7</a>d). This rate is nonetheless higher than what was reported experimentally in some of other tropical regions such as the Barra Bonita Reservoir (1.36â1.77 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>M N <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span>) <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Abe2003">Abe et al. 2003</a>)</span>. According to this study, denitrification processes in tropical conditions often occur with a high intensity because of the fast DO consumption (aerobic respiration) by heterotrophic bacteria using the high labile organic carbon. Such an environmental setting is consistent with the Saigon Riverâs conditions in the urban section where low oxygen concentrations are frequent during the dry season (~ 1.0 mg<span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>).</p>

<p>The simulated aerobic degradation rate in the Saigon River Estuary ranges from 5 to 6.5 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>M C <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span>. In addition, in the urban section, the intensity of aerobic degradation does not appear to be as high as other processes when receiving contaminated water from urban canals. This could be explained by the low availability of DO in this section (~1.0 mg<span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>, Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-tide">4.6</a>) that makes the TOC degradation preferentially anaerobic (i.e., denitrification) as observed in Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-process">4.7</a>b. The sum of TOC consumption by the aerobic degradation and denitrification almost equals the TOC production by phytoplankton mortality (8.5 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>M C <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span>) in urban section. Therefore, a biogeochemical balance is reached in this section which does not reduce TOC concentration. However, TOCâs net biogeochemical reactions are negative in upstream and downstream. This would lead to a decrease in TOC concentrations in these two sections. However, according to the observations, the TOC concentration from reservoir to km 80 is almost constant. Other sources of TOC in the upstream section can be the cause of TOC compensation due to the aerobic degradation process. According to a well-water quality survey from 233 wells in agricultural, urban and industrial areas of HCMC, the wells with high concentration of organic carbon are only observed in agricultural areas (upstream of Saigon River) <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2020b">B. T. Nguyen, Nguyen, and Bach 2020</a>)</span>. This suggests that agricultural activities in the upstream Saigon River can release high TOC content, affecting groundwater and surface water in this area.</p>
<p>Compared to previous biogeochemical applications of C-GEM <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Volta2016">Chiara Volta et al. 2016</a>)</span>, the aerobic degradation constant rate applied in our study was set at the low end of the range of possible values for this parameter (Table <a href="#tab:C4-table3-sediment"><strong>??</strong></a>). Such low value strongly diverges with some studies performed in highly urbanized estuaries such as the Recife estuarine system (Brazil). <span class="citation">Noriega, Araujo, and LefÃ¨vre (<a href="references.html#ref-Noriega2013">2013</a>)</span> also argued that the respiration process was the dominant process in a highly urbanized estuary which was the cause of the constant low oxygen concentration. Unlike the Recife estuarine system, the low oxygen concentrations in the Saigon River would be due to the nitrification of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> brought by urban canals, as shown by increasing <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_3^{-}}\)</span> concentration (from about 0.5 to 1.1 mg<span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>) in the urban section. The TOC degradation might strongly occur in the canal system with a long residence time before discharging to the Saigon River. We assumed that the less labile organic carbon was mainly stay in mainstream of Saigon River while the labile organic carbon was already degraded in the inner canal system. Based on C-GEM application in typical temperate estuaries <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Volta2016">Chiara Volta et al. 2016</a>)</span>, the aerobic degradation rate could reach 20 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>M C <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span>, which was about two times higher than in our study. Although aerobic degradation was reported to be the main factor leading to oxygen depletion in many studies carried out in other systems, nitrification was the main factor in this tropical estuary.</p>

<p>NPP uses nutrients and produces <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{O_{2}}\)</span>. In the Saigon River, NPP only plays a minor role in eliminating nutrient pollution but still contributes to the oxygen regeneration in the system. In the urban section, oxygen seems to be a scarce element because of its consumption through nitrification and aerobic degradation. However, the intensity of oxygen production through NPP is similar to the oxygen exchange in the urban area (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-process">4.7</a>a), but is negligible upstream and downstream due to low phytoplankton levels. While <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> is consumed by nitrification and NPP, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> can only be consumed through primary production in C-GEM. Besides, the production of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> by aerobic degradation and denitrification is higher than the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> uptake associated with primary production in the Saigon Riverâs urban section, a positive net biogeochemical reaction that led to an increase in <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> in this section (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-process">4.7</a>e).</p>
<p>NPP is the only process in C-GEM that consumes silica. Silica is a naturally occurring element essential for the development of diatoms which account for about 90% of the total phytoplankton observed in the Saigon River in the dry season <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2021b">An Truong Nguyen et al. 2021</a>)</span>. According to the Redfield stoichiometric ratio in the Saigon River, DSi was always in excess over nitrogen and phosphorus for diatomâs development <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2019">T. T. N. Nguyen, NÃ©mery, Gratiot, Strady, et al. 2019</a>)</span> and its availability is thus never a limiting factor to diatomâs growth currently. DSi concentrations however, are relatively low in the upstream section (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-Model-quality">4.5</a>h, km 0 to km 60), but they are 2-3 times higher in the urban section (km 80 to km 160), where diatom frustule dissolution might occur in this highly productive section, accentuated by e.g., resuspension by navigation, feeding in return diatom uptake, feeding in return diatom uptake. In addition, the increase in DSi could come from high concentration of DSi of tributaries (see Table <a href="#tab:C4-table4-BC"><strong>??</strong></a>) and groundwater (not taken as an input by C-GEM). Indeed, according to <span class="citation">Oehler et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Oehler2019">2019</a>)</span>, DSi concentration in the water column can be particularly elevated during the ebb tide by the contribution of DSi in groundwater which is greater than in surface water. Further, results of interaction analysis between groundwater and river showed that Saigon River indeed received water from groundwater at upstream and contributed to groundwater at downstream <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Van2018">Van and Koontanakulvong 2018</a>)</span>. In the following downstream section, the concentration of DSi then decreases because of dilution with the sea and the Dongnai River (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-Model-quality">4.5</a>h) . There might be a risk of DSi depletion and the formation of harmful non-diatom phytoplankton if the pollutant cloud (from km 98 to km 138, Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-tide">4.6</a>a) further spreads towards the upstream section. The decrease in freshwater inflow and the increase in tidal amplitude could indeed move the pollutant cloud upstream (Park and Song, 2018). However, the freshwater discharge from Dau Tieng Lake (upstream of Saigon River Estuary) is usually maintained at a stable level during the dry season <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Ngoc2014">Trieu, Hiramatsu, and Harada 2014</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>In the Saigon River, about 90% of the nutrients from untreated wastewaters are retained in sludge within the canal network of HCMC and partly lost (denitrified into N2) <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2020">T. T. N. Nguyen et al. 2020</a>)</span>. These polluted sludges are occasionally removed through canal dredging programs. However, at the output of canals, about 10% of the wastewater still has a very high concentration in nutrients and organic matter, well beyond the thresholds recommended by the Vietnamese regulation on surface water quality QCVN 08:2015/BTNMT.</p>
<p>In the urban section of the Saigon River Estuary, the average fluxes of DO, TOC, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> were 8.1 ton<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{O_{2}}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span>, 15.5 tonC <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span> and 2.2 tonN <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span>, respectively. Biogeochemical reaction fluxes remove 12% of DO, 1% of TOC and 18% of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> within the urban section. These results show that the Saigon River Estuary is more effective at transforming/removing nutrients than organic carbon. Nitrification plays a key role in the self-purification of the Saigon River Estuary (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-flux">4.8</a>c). Phytoplanktonâs contribution to the removal of nutrients is negligible, but NPP contributes to the oxygenation of water in the urban section. Nitrification consumes about 2 ton<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{O_{2}}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span>, while NPP provides about 0.75 ton<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{O_{2}}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span>. The high abundance of phytoplankton facilitates an increase of TOC through the phytoplankton mortality process. The phytoplankton mortality flux in the urban section reaches 0.30 tonC <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span>, while the aerobic degradation only removed 0.27 tonC<span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span> (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-flux">4.8</a>b). This makes the Saigon River Estuary an inefficient TOC filter, which is a strong difference with the behavior of several temperate systems <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Laruelle2017">G. Laruelle et al. 2017</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Laruelle2019">Goulven G. Laruelle et al. 2019</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Volta2016b">C. Volta, Laruelle, and Regnier 2016</a>)</span> calculated using C-GEM.</p>
<p>In the downstream section, the flux calculation mainly depends on the Dongnai Riverâs fluxes, with a much higher discharge than in the Saigon River. The reaction fluxes are negligible and only reduce the downstream fluxes by 2 - 4%. As discussed earlier, the concentrations of water quality variables in the downstream section of the Saigon River are almost similar to those in the Dongnai River with a good water quality status. Therefore, the biogeochemical reactions in this section are weaker than in the urban section. The most notable difference between these sections is the dominant biogeochemical processes. While nitrification has a strong impact on DO in the urban section, this process is much weaker in the downstream section. Oxygen supply through gas exchange (7.25 ton<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{O_{2}}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span>) plays a key role in improving DO in this section (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-flux">4.8</a>a), compensating for the consumption taking place upstream. Besides, TOC degradation is also larger than the TOC produced by phytoplankton mortality. However, the overall net biogeochemical flux is not significant compared to the TOC flux downstream of the Saigon River (Figure <a href="steady-state-model.html#fig:C4-flux">4.8</a>b).</p>
<p>Compared to other studies, the self-purification capacity of the Saigon River based on biogeochemical processes is relatively small. For example, the Scheldt Estuary (Belgium, Netherlands) in the 1990s received high concentrations of lateral inputs and could consumed 73% <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span>, 78% TOC and almost all <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{O_{2}}\)</span> <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Vanderborght2007">Vanderborght et al. 2007</a>)</span>. Another modelling study conducted in the Pearl River Estuary, a sub-tropical estuary in China, one of the most densely populated and economically developed regions of the country, showed that the biogeochemical processes could eliminate 50% BOD and 37% of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> in the estuary <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Hu2009">J. Hu and Li 2009</a>)</span>. The lower reduction capacity in the Saigon River Estuary can be explained by the high retention or removal of pollutants in the inner canal system of HCMC. While the Pearl River Estuary or Scheldt Estuary can remove high amounts of both organic carbon and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span>, in the Saigon River Estuary, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> was mostly left for removal. The high concentration of TOC created by phytoplankton mortality process, mostly biodegradable, would effectively fuel aerobic degradation process within water column and TOC removal. This would mean that urban TOC discharged in the mainstream would be refractory, the biodegradable fraction of TOC being directly consumed in the canals. As a result, the urban canal and river (VT) network within the city plays a role of pretreatment, mineralizing first TOC and lowering oxygen, before the urban effluents reach the river itself where ammonia could find enough oxygen for nitrification.</p>
<p>Overall, our simulations suggest that the urban section of Saigon River mainly plays a role in retaining/eliminating macropollutants, which can be explained by the low flushing and long residence time, especially during the dry season. In the downstream section, the large discharge from the Dongnai River increases the capacity of the system to flush out pollutants into the coastal waters. In this downstream area, biogeochemical reactions then only play a minor role (2-4%) compared to hydro-physical controls.</p>

<p>Water quality in tropical estuaries is often under great pressure from urban and industrial wastewater sources, especially in developing countries. The lack of extensive monitoring programs in such regions makes difficulties in developing or applying water quality models for water management in these estuaries. In this study, the application of a generic reaction-transport model (C-GEM) allows to describe the dynamics of biogeochemical reactions and tidal effects on the water quality in a tropical estuary (the Saigon River Estuary, Vietnam). The simulation results capture the movement of a pollutant cloud in this estuary which confirms the impact of megapole wastewater on water quality. During the dry season, this cloud (30km stretch) moves up and down within a radius of 10km within the urban section of Saigon River Estuary, under the combined influences of the tidal effect and low discharge. In addition, a long residence time and high nutrient concentrations facilitate the development of phytoplankton which rapidly grows in such conditions. C-GEM allows quantifying the intensity of the different biogeochemical processes controlling nutrient dynamics in the system. Nitrification plays an important role in the Saigon River Estuary, removing about 18% of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> flux in the urban section. The contribution of phytoplankton growth to the consumption of nutrients was negligible, but significant to the improvement of DO in a water column. Unlike many studies in other estuaries, the Saigon River Estuary only removed TOC originating from phytoplankton. Untreated ammonia-rich effluents were not diluted in the dry season, which indeed favored nitrification. This study indicated that the optimal temperature and abundant nutrients created favorable conditions for the growth of nitrifying bacteria in tropical estuaries. This study highlighted some fundamental differences between sanitation conditions in high- and low-income countries, the latter showing higher vulnerability as furthermore located in tropical zones.</p>
