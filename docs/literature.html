<p>This chapter presents a literature review of estuaries regarding water quality, focusing on tropical estuaries and the impacts of urban/wastewaters policies. In addition, knowledge gaps are shown in understanding the factors (such as hydrological regimes, biogeochemical processes) controlling water quality in tropical and temperate estuaries. In general, the growth of megacities is putting increasing pressure on the water quality of estuaries and coastal areas, a trend that is exacerbated in developing countries. Eutrophication and greenhouse gas emissions in tropical estuaries are expected to increase in the future. However, difficulties in monitoring and applying biogeochemical models in estuaries have made it difficult to promote effective management policies. Current knowledge shows that the dynamics of nutrients and phytoplankton are complex under the influence of interactions of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) cycles and hydrological regimes (inflow discharge, residence time). Appropriate monitoring programs (location and frequency of sampling) are required to apprehend spatial and temporal variations in water quality in estuaries. The application of reaction-transport models can allow understanding the mechanisms of these processes. Data requirements are still the main challenge to applying these models in developing countries. However, if there are no models capable of accurately describing the evolution of phytoplankton and the purification capacity of estuaries, solutions to reduce pollutants such as the construction of wastewater treatment plants will not be effective. Therefore, developing a suitable model for urbanized tropical estuaries is extremely important to urbanization and ongoing climate changes</p>

<p>Estuaries are transitional areas between rivers and seas, transporting nutrients from rivers to seas. Estuaries have both river and sea characteristics, making them an area with rich and diverse ecosystems, providing resources and playing an important role in human development. That is why most densely populated areas are situated in coastal areas near estuaries <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Vitousek2008">Vitousek et al. 1997</a>)</span>. In addition, estuaries are also considered as a buffer zone capable of holding and removing human-induced pollutants <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Savenije2012">H. H. G. Savenije 2012</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Estuaries are different from rivers and lakes hydrodynamically, chemically, and biologically. Compared to rivers and lakes, the unique characteristics of estuaries include the following (1) tides are a major driving force, (2) salinity and its variations usually play a significant role in hydrodynamics and water quality processes, (3) two-directional net flows (Figure <a href="literature.html#fig:C1-fig-estuary">1.1</a>). For pollutant transport aspect, flushing of pollutants is driven primarily by advection in rivers, while in estuaries, both advection and dispersion (mixing and turbulent diffusion) affect the transport of pollutants <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Martin1998">Martin, McCutcheon, and Schottman 1998</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Studying the relationship between geometry and hydrodynamics is significant in reducing data requirements for hydrodynamics models in estuaries <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Savenije2001">H. H. G. G. Savenije 2001</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Savenije2012">H. H. G. Savenije 2012</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Regnier2013">Pierre Regnier et al. 2013</a>)</span>. According to <span class="citation">Hubert H. G. Savenije (<a href="references.html#ref-Savenije2005">2005</a>)</span>, the geometries of alluvial estuaries often have common characteristics. Estuarine width and estuarine cross-sectional area typically decrease exponentially with distance from the mouth. Therefore, the geometry of estuaries can be expressed through a function of convergence lengths. Estuaries with funnel-like shapes (diminishing in width from estuary mouth to upstream) have short convergence lengths and small inflow, while prismatic estuaries have long convergence lengths and higher inflow <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Savenije2012">H. H. G. Savenije 2012</a>)</span>. Estuaries with funnel-shape also exhibit tidal dominance over inflow discharge; in other words, these estuaries often observe the saline intrusion <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Jiang2020">Jiang et al. 2020</a>)</span>. <span class="citation">Hubert H. G. Savenije (<a href="references.html#ref-Savenije2005">2005</a>)</span> suggested that the salt intrusion length at these estuaries is typically about two-thirds of the total estuarine length. For example, funnel-shaped estuaries, such as Scheldt (in Belgium), Delaware (in the USA), and Saigon (in Vietnam), are marine-dominated estuaries with short convergent lengths and long saline intrusion. Besides, features such as short convergence length, long salt intrusion length, funnel-shape estuaries often have long residence time, about 60–90 days in the Scheldt, 80 days in the Delaware estuary <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Savenije2012">H. H. G. Savenije 2012</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Regnier2013">Pierre Regnier et al. 2013</a>)</span>.

<p>The tide is generated by interactions in the planetary ocean topography with Earth, Sun and Moon gravitational forces (principally). It acts as a periodic function consisting of multiple frequency components. The dominant periods are in the order of 12.3 (semi-diurnal) and 24 (diurnal) hours <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Savenije2012">H. H. G. Savenije 2012</a>)</span>. Tidal excursion, tidal amplitude and tidal periods are factors controlling the variation of water quality in estuaries.</p>
<p>Understanding and describing tidal oscillations in estuaries are extremely important in water quality modeling because (1) tides are a major factor controlling the flushing time of many estuaries, (2) tidal currents are largely responsible for turbulence and mixing in estuaries, and (3) tidal currents can generate residual flow that affects the long-term transport of pollutants <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-hugo1979">Hugo Fischer 1979</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Regnier1997">P.

</div>
<p>Figure <a href="literature.html#fig:C1-fig-tidal">1.2</a> illustrates the tidal variation and shows the important definitions related to tides.</p>
<p>Tides can be described as the sum of tidal constituents. Each constituent is a harmonic oscillation and has its amplitude, period, and phase, which can be extracted from measured tidal data using the harmonic analysis. The first five constituents, <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(S_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(O_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(K_1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(N_2\)</span> (Table <a href="#tab:C1-tide"><strong>??</strong></a>), are generally the most important tidal constituents <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Martin1998">Martin, McCutcheon, and Schottman 1998</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Ji2017">Ji 2017</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Savenije2012">H. H. G. Savenije 2012</a>)</span>. For most systems, there will be two high and two low tides on the tidal curve per tidal day (or lunar day, about 24.84 h). Tides that occur twice during a tidal day are called semi-diurnal tides. Some areas, such as estuaries in the Gulf of Mexico, have only one high and one low tide per day, or daily tides. In most estuaries connected to the Pacific Ocean, the magnitudes may be quite different, resulting in what is known as <em>mixed tides</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Martin1998">Martin, McCutcheon, and Schottman 1998</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Another important definition related to tidal effects on pollutant transport is the tidal excursion. The tidal excursion is the distance that a particle travels from low to high water, or vice versa <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Savenije2012">H. H. G. Savenije 2012</a>)</span>. This parameter is useful for describing the movement of pollutants in estuaries within tidal cycles. Freshwater inflows impose a net seaward movement on water particles over a tidal cycle. Hence, the ebb-tidal excursion should be slightly larger than the flood tidal excursion. For a typical maximum tidal velocity of 1 m <span class="math inline">\(s^{-1}\)</span> and an <span class="math inline">\(M_2\)</span> period of 12.42 h, the tidal excursion is 14.2 km <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Ji2017">Ji 2017</a>)</span>. Major factors that influence the propagation and amplitude of tides include bottom friction, water depth and shoreline, and Coriolis force <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Savenije2012">H. H. G. Savenije 2012</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>The transport of pollutants and salinity intrusion at alluvial estuaries contribute to the estuarine shape and inflow discharge <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Savenije2012">H. H. G. Savenije 2012</a>)</span>. Salinity ranges from 0 to 33 ppt in estuaries and ∼35 ppt in the open oceans <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Ji2017">Ji 2017</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Savenije2012">H. H. G. Savenije 2012</a>)</span>. Figure <a href="literature.html#fig:C1-fig-salinity">1.3</a> shows the influence of freshwater inflow on salinity intrusion in tidal estuaries. The well-mixed estuary occurs during low flow, resulting in a deeper salt intrusion <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Savenije2012">H. H. G. Savenije 2012</a>)</span>. In tropical estuaries, seasonal fluctuations in freshwater inflow often cause saltwater intrusion markedly different between the two seasons. In the dry season with low freshwater inflow, saline intrusion can often reach inland (Figure <a href="literature.html#fig:C1-fig-salinity">1.3</a>c), whereas in the rainy season, there is almost no effect of salinity (Figure <a href="literature.html#fig:C1-fig-salinity">1.3</a>a).</p>

<p>Besides the impact of freshwater inflow on salinity intrusion, inflow also directly affects the flushing time (also so-called residence time) of estuaries <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Martin1998">Martin, McCutcheon, and Schottman 1998</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Regnier1998">P.

The flushing time of estuaries represents the average time required to remove a fluid particle of freshwater or a conservative tracer from an upstream location (freshwater inflow) in an estuary to the sea. The flushing time is thus often used in the analysis of pollutant transport in estuaries <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Ji2017">Ji 2017</a>)</span>. The flushing time in the estuary can be estimated from the volume of the estuary divided by the freshwater flow rate. Large freshwater inflow and strong tides lead to short flushing time <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Martin1998">Martin, McCutcheon, and Schottman 1998</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Flushing time can affect the hydrodynamics, sediment distribution, and water quality processes such as eutrophication. An estuary with a very short flushing time is unlikely to have algal blooms because algae may not have enough time to grow before flushing out of the system <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Lancelot2011">Lancelot and Muylaert 2011</a>)</span>. In addition, a waterbody with flushing shorter than the doubling time of algal cells inhibits the formation of algal blooms <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Ji2017">Ji 2017</a>)</span>. Therefore, the flushing time is useful to evaluate the exchange rates of biogeochemical processes in estuarine systems such as nutrient fluxes, chlorophyll-<em>a</em> concentrations, primary production <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Bianchi2007">Bianchi 2007</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Dissolved oxygen (DO) is the most important parameter of water quality and is used to measure the available oxygen for biochemical activity in water. DO is depleted by oxidation of organic carbon, nitrification, and respiration and is replenished by surface exchange and photosynthesis <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Bianchi2007">Bianchi 2007</a>)</span>. In polluted waters, bacterial oxygen consumption can rapidly outpace oxygen replenishment from the atmosphere and plant photosynthesis <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Vanderborght2007">Vanderborght et al. 2007</a>)</span>. The order of substances consumed in the water column of the estuaries depends on the oxygen conditions in the water.

In water quality modeling studies, organic carbon can be divided into fast rate (labile) and slower rate (refractory) organic carbon. Labile particulate organic carbon (LPOC) has a decomposition time scale of days to weeks. Refractory particulate organic carbon (RPOC) has a decomposition time scale of months to seasons after settling and compacting into the sediment bed <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Ji2017">Ji 2017</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Sources of organic carbon</strong></p>
<p>Unlike oxygen, whose origin is mainly from photosynthesis and exchange with the atmosphere, organic carbon comes from allochthonous and autochthonous sources. Specifically, organic carbon can come from organisms such as algae in estuaries and external sources such as wastewater, soils runoff, and groundwater input <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Bianchi2007">Bianchi 2007</a>)</span>. In estuarine systems with strong human impact, the predominant organic carbon source often has high RPOC and low LPOC ratios <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Ji2017">Ji 2017</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Bianchi2007">Bianchi 2007</a>)</span>. Sediments may also represent an important source to the water column of shallow estuarine systems <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Bianchi2007">Bianchi 2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In some estuaries, the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) is generally positively correlated with phytoplankton biomass, which indicates phytoplankton’s dominance in organic carbon sources <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Bianchi2007">Bianchi 2007</a>)</span>. However, many estuarine systems do not show positive correlations with phytoplankton biomass because of allochthonous inputs from soils, groundwater. The riverine sources are highly refractory in these estuaries, with only minor input from algal sources <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Bianchi2007">Bianchi 2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon cycle in estuaries</strong></p>
<p>The organic carbon cycle is closely related to nutrient cycles, including photosynthesis, respiration, and decomposition <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Bianchi2007">Bianchi 2007</a>)</span>. The processes of carbon also depend on the oxygen condition in the water (Table <a href="#tab:CH1-table2-reaction"><strong>??</strong></a>). Figure <a href="literature.html#fig:C1-fig-C">1.4</a> depicts the carbon cycle in aquatic systems, including major processes such as primary production, aerobic decomposition, and anaerobic decomposition. Under oxic conditions, bacteria decompose organic material to obtain energy for growth, break it down into simpler organic substances, and eventually convert it into inorganic substances. When insufficient oxygen is available, the resulting anaerobic decomposition is performed by completely different microorganisms <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Ji2017">Ji 2017</a>)</span>. This process can produce hydrogen sulfide (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{H_2S}\)</span>), ammonia (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_3}\)</span>), and methane (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_{4}}\)</span>). The sequence transformation of OC under oxic and anoxic conditions is presented in Table <a href="#tab:CH1-table2-reaction"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Together with hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen, nitrogen is an essential element for living biomass. Nitrogen can thus limit rates of primary production in the aquatic system. The primary forms of reactive nitrogen which algae and bacteria can assimilate are nitrate, nitrite, ammonium <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Likens2010">Likens 2010</a>)</span>. In estuarine systems, dominant inputs of N are linked to freshwater inputs from rivers <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nixon1995">Nixon 1995</a>)</span>. Besides, groundwater discharge of N to estuaries has also been important <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Bianchi2007">Bianchi 2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Nitrogen cycles in estuaries</strong></p>
<p>There are five main processes affecting N concentrations: nitrogen fixation, mineralization, nitrification, denitrification, algal uptake, anammox (Figure <a href="literature.html#fig:C1-fig-N">1.5</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Nitrogen fixation: Some blue-green algae can directly fix <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2}\)</span> from the atmosphere. This process is usually insignificant in modeling studies.</p></li>
<li><p>Mineralization: Organic nitrogen can be converted to <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_{4}^{+}}\)</span> via mineralization.</p></li>
<li><p>Nitrification: Under aerobic conditions, ammonia is oxidized to nitrite and nitrate via nitrification.</p></li>
<li><p>Denitrification: Under anaerobic conditions, nitrate is reduced to gas forms as <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_{2}O}\)</span> and then released out of the water system.</p></li>
<li><p>Algal uptake: Algae consume <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_{4}^{+}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_3^{-}}\)</span>for growth via the photosynthetic process.

</h4>
<p>Phosphorus (P) is an important element in aquatic ecosystems because it limits primary production <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Bianchi2007">Bianchi 2007</a>)</span>. P is usually divided into the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Orthophosphate</em> frequently used to represent soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). Orthophosphate constitutes the majority of phosphates. Many studies have focused on the <em>soluble reactive P</em> (SRP) <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Bianchi2007">Bianchi 2007</a>)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Organic phosphate</em> is often found in plant tissue, waste solids, or other organic material. After decomposition, they can be converted to orthophosphate.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike N, phosphorus does not have a gaseous phase. P has low solubility and is strongly adsorbed onto suspended solids that settle out of the water column.</p>
<p><strong>Source of P</strong></p>
<p>The pollution source of P often comes from human activities such as agricultural practices, domestic wastewater and animal production <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Likens2010">Likens 2010</a>)</span>. Unlike N, inputs of atmospheric P sources are generally considered insignificant to coastal systems <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Bianchi2007">Bianchi 2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>P cycles in estuaries</strong></p>
<p>The P cycle operates similarly to the N cycle in many aspects, except the sorption process. Algae and plants take up dissolved phosphate (largely <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_{4}^{3-}}\)</span>), incorporate it into the food chain, and eventually return it to the water as organic P <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Vilmin2015">Vilmin et al. 2015</a>)</span>. Particulate phosphate sorbs to sediments and settle to the sediment bed <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Vilmin2015">Vilmin et al. 2015</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-AissaGrouz2018">Aissa-Grouz, Garnier, and Billen 2018</a>)</span>. The fate and transport processes of phosphate are thus strongly influenced by the suspended sediment and sediment processes (Figure <a href="literature.html#fig:C1-fig-P">1.6</a>). It includes (1) inflow and outflow, (2) settling of the particulate P in the water column, (3); sorption and desorption in both the water column and the bed, (4); exchange between the water column and the bed via deposition/resuspension and diffusion, (5); losses by burial, and (6) algal uptake and metabolism.</p>

<p>Silicon is an element required for the growth of some phytoplankton species. In water, silicates can convert to orthosilicic acid, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Si(OH)_4}\)</span>, the form that can be directly consumed by diatoms <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Ji2017">Ji 2017</a>)</span>. Silica in waterbodies largely originates from the weathering and erosion of rocks on lands, and its concentrations in freshwater systems are usually between 0.7 and 7 mg<span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> (Horn and Goldman, 1994). Silica sources from human activities are usually minor, which is around 10% of the annual river load of DSi <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Likens2010">Likens 2010</a>)</span>. The decrease of DSi is mainly due to diatom consumption, some studies have seen this phenomenon, but some activities such as dams can also reduce the DSi concentration.</p>
<p>As discussed above, the silica cycle is not as complex as C, N and P but is mainly concerned with the growth of diatoms, a phytoplankton group that uptake silica for development, forming an outer shell known as a frustule. After a diatom dies, DSi is released again to the water column and other nutrients through remineralization <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Ji2017">Ji 2017</a>)</span>. Diatoms take up N, Si and P in a molar ratio of about 16:16:1 (N:P: Si). When dissolved silica (DSi) is depleted, the growth of diatoms is reduced, eventually leading to DSi concentrations limiting their growth. For instance, Chesapeake Bay exhibited strong Si limitation, with the ratio of available nutrients (Si:P) in the range of 100–300. The diatoms will then be replaced by other algae, such as green algae or cyanobacteria, that do not require DSi <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Likens2010">Likens 2010</a>)</span>. In some urbanized estuaries, DSi limitation of diatoms has become more frequent because of increasing N and P inputs. Therefore, the increase in harmful algal blooms in estuaries over the past few decades may partly be due to lower Si availability <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Likens2010">Likens 2010</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Phytoplankton is an autotrophic organism and a key part of ocean and freshwater ecosystems. <span class="citation">Pierella Karlusich, Ibarbalz, and Bowler (<a href="references.html#ref-PierellaKarlusich2020">2020</a>)</span> reported that phytoplankton contributes to half of the global photosynthetic activity and can produce for 50% of dissolved oxygen in ocean.</p>
<p><strong>Redfield ratio</strong></p>
<p>Redfield ratio is commonly used to infer resource limitation in phytoplankton growth, which simply states that organisms will become limited by the resource in the lowest supply relative to their needs. Based on this ratio, Stumm and Morgan (1996) further modified the stoichiometry of the chemical reaction of photosynthesis (primary production) and oxidation (degradation) of organic matter by the following equation:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{106CO_2 + 16HNO_3 +H_3PO_4 + 122H_2O \leftrightarrow (CH_2O)_{106} (NH_3)_{16}H_3PO_4 + 138O_2}\)</span></p>
<p>The ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus in phytoplankton biomass is usually in the range of 16:1 by moles (the ‘Redfield ratio’). If the N:P ratio is lower than 16:1, then N becomes the limiting factor for phytoplankton. However, most aquatic systems have P as a limiting factor <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Likens2010">Likens 2010</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Bianchi2007">Bianchi 2007</a>)</span>. This can be explained by the treatment efficiency of P higher than N by the wastewater treatment plants. In addition, P is often easily adsorbed onto the sediment and buried in the riverbed.</p>
<p><strong>Factors controlling phytoplankton growth</strong></p>
<p>Seasonal changes in phytoplankton abundance and composition are primarily controlled by changes in riverine inputs, nutrients, tidal variability, algal respiration, light availability and consumption by grazers <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Bianchi2007">Bianchi 2007</a>)</span>. In estuaries, the phytoplankton dynamics are controlled by salinity gradient, light availability, and water residence time <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Lancelot2011">Lancelot and Muylaert 2011</a>)</span>. The most important factors controlling phytoplankton growth are the nutrients’ source and the ratio of these nutrient components (C, N, P) in the water. Processes that lead to a change in the concentration and ratio of nutrients will change the density of phytoplankton. Of particular importance for phosphorus is the adsorption to sediment particles in case of P limitation <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Likens2010">Likens 2010</a>)</span>. Algae consume nutrients in a fixed stoichiometric ratio, and this ratio is relatively constant. When the limiting nutrient is depleted, the algal concentrations stop increasing, and the eutrophication process is retarded or even reversed. <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_{2}}\)</span> is often not the limiting nutrient because of its dominance in nature. Silica receives little emphasis in water quality management because its abundant supply from natural sources is difficult to control.</p>

<p>The imbalance between wastewater treatment efficiency and total wastewater emissions in developing countries in this century is similar to emissions in developed countries in temperate regions in the last century. In general, the studies in these areas showed a correlation between population and pollution emissions. Based on synthesis of <span class="citation">Bianchi (<a href="references.html#ref-Bianchi2007">2007</a>)</span>, some notable reports are as follows. Survey results at the Skidaway River estuary (USA) from 1986 to 1996 showed a linear correlation between population growth and dissolved nutrients entering this estuary. During the 1990s, southeastern Queensland, Australia, was one of the most rapidly urbanizing regions globally, also observed this correlation. An increase in nutrients from industrial, agricultural, and municipal wastewater has contaminated estuarine waters, although estuaries are generally considered highly self-cleaning due to biogeochemical processes and seawater dilution. The eutrophication phenomenon was observed in many estuaries in temperate countries in the last century <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Howarth2011">Howarth et al. 2011</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Billen2011">Gilles Billen et al. 2011</a>)</span>.</p>

River-dominated estuaries (with large freshwater inflow) typically have a strong flushing capacity (short retention time) with a lower estuarine retention capacity than estuaries with a long retention time. <span class="citation">Le et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Le2010">2010</a>)</span> found that in tropical systems, there are higher phosphate retention and lower silica retention than the temperate systems, while nitrogen retention was quite similar in these systems.

<p>Table <a href="#tab:CH1-table4-tropical"><strong>??</strong></a> details the differences between tropical and temperate estuaries in terms of nutrient retention and removal in estuaries before discharge into the sea. In addition, the differences in hydrological conditions, climate, and dominant biogeochemical processes of these two regional estuaries are compared. Hydrologically, temperate estuaries generally have a more stable upstream discharge than tropical estuaries.

<p>Eutrophication is defined as a natural process of increasing the organic material production over time. However, the research and definition of eutrophication mainly focus on “anthropogenic eutrophication” that is, the process of eutrophication under the human influence <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-LeMoal2019">Le Moal et al. 2019</a>)</span>. Anthropogenic eutrophication is defined as a syndrome of an aquatic ecosystem associated with the overproduction of organic material induced by anthropogenic inputs of phosphorus and nitrogen <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-LeMoal2019">Le Moal et al. 2019</a>)</span>. In general, an increase in nutrient inputs causes an increase in phytoplankton biomass and a decrease in light penetration in the water column, producing an undesirable disturbance to the balance of organisms in the water <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Durand2011">Durand et al. 2011</a>)</span>. Figure <a href="literature.html#fig:C1-fig-eutrophication">1.10</a> depicts the interpretation of an increase in eutrophication under increasing water nutrients, leading to an increase in phytoplankton in the water, beginning with diatoms then macrophytes. When the number growth of diatoms is maximum, the oxygen in the water is depleted, and the formation of harmful phytoplankton species such as cyanobacteria replaces diatoms, and biodiversity in the water also decreases.</p>
<p><strong>A literature review of eutrophication</strong></p>
<p>Studies on eutrophication have been numerous since the 1970s but focused solely on explaining the causes and consequences of eutrophication for lakes. Eutrophication in estuaries and coastal areas has been studied extensively since the 1990s <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-InterResearch">Cloern 2001</a>)</span>. These days, eutrophication studies in rivers, estuaries and coastal areas are viewed as a “new wine” in an “old bottle” <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-LeMoal2019">Le Moal et al. 2019</a>)</span>. Research on eutrophication is considered the new wine because nutrient pollution (as the main cause of eutrophication) has changed from excess phosphorus to excess nitrogen. Meanwhile, consequences of eutrophication such as algal bloom, anoxia from the 1970s in the lakes are still present in rivers, estuaries and coastal areas today <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-LeMoal2019">Le Moal et al. 2019</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>The conceptual model of eutrophication and consequences is shown in Figure <a href="literature.html#fig:C1-fig-eutrophication-effect">1.11</a>. The mechanism and consequences of eutrophication in different aquatic systems share the same general mechanism of eutrophication development <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Whitall2007">Whitall et al. 2007</a>)</span>. The intensity of eutrophication depends on environmental factors, residence times, high temperatures, and sufficient light utilization <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-LeMoal2019">Le Moal et al. 2019</a>)</span>. The little difference between the current conceptual model of eutrophication for estuaries and other aquatic systems is the change in rates of ecosystem metabolism <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Whitall2007">Whitall et al. 2007</a>)</span>. The most notable effects of eutrophication are algal proliferation, or blooms, leading to large biomass production. Then these large biomasses are degraded, resulting in oxygen depletion in the aquatic environment. The hypoxia or anoxia condition can change all the communities’ structure and function (plants, zooplankton, benthic fauna, fish). There is also the formation of toxic gases such as <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{H_2S}\)</span>, or greenhouse gases (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_{2}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_{4}}\)</span>) <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-LeMoal2019">Le Moal et al. 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Eutrophication not only harms aquatic organisms but also directly affects the economy and human health. For example, the formation of toxic phytoplankton such as cyanobacteria has affected drinking water sources of approximately 400,000 residents in Ohio (USA) in 2014 <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Smith2015b">D. R. Smith, King, and Williams 2015</a>)</span>.

Although there are no statistics on the impact of eutrophication in developing countries, particularly in Asia, these reports in developed countries suggest that human health and economic losses in developing countries may be stronger because of the increasing severity of eutrophication in recent years.</p>

<p>In addition to studies warning about the risk of eutrophication in estuaries, there has been more and more research on greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) in recent years <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Daniel2013">Daniel, DeGrandpre, and Farías 2013</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Borges2018">Borges et al. 2018</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Marescaux2018">Marescaux, Thieu, and Garnier 2018</a>)</span>.

<p>Although estuaries occupy a small portion of the global ocean area (about 0.2-0.3%), their <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_{2}}\)</span> emissions are a disproportionately large flux (about 0.25 Pg C <span class="math inline">\(yr^{-1}\)</span>) compared to the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_{2}}\)</span> exchanges between the open ocean and atmosphere (<span class="citation">Bauer et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Bauer2013">2013</a>)</span>, Figure <a href="literature.html#fig:C1-fig-CO2">1.12</a>). Similarly, <span class="citation">Hermann W. Bange (<a href="references.html#ref-Bange2006">2006</a>)</span> estimated that <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_{2}O}\)</span> accounted for about 33% of the oceanic greenhouse gases emission. In the study of Global Methane Budget 2000–2017, <span class="citation">Saunois et al.

While <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_{2}}\)</span> makes the largest contribution in terms of concentration to global warming, methane (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_{4}}\)</span>) and nitrous oxide (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_{2}O}\)</span>) are important trace gases in the atmosphere. <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_{4}}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_{2}O}\)</span> absorb infrared radiation respectively 300 and 25 times more effectively, than <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_{2}}\)</span> <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Burgos2015">M.

<p>Studies on the impact of urbanization on tropical estuaries are still limited.

In addition, studies in urbanized tropical estuaries mainly focused on one or two GHGs, and only surveyed a short period without season effects and a short area (focus mainly urban area). This leads to interpretations of the interaction of eutrophication and GHGs that are not fully described. For example, the reduction of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_{2}}\)</span> towards the sea may be due to either dilution, consumption of phytoplankton <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Noriega2013">Noriega, Araujo, and Lefèvre 2013</a>)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_{2}}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_{4}}\)</span> conversion.

The failure to control “materials that are put into the estuaries” is due to a lack of balance between wastewater volume and wastewater treatment capacity.

<p>While these failures have been and are being remedied in developed countries, they are increasingly common in emerging countries with megacities. Ultimately, addressing these issues requires understanding the nutrient dynamics at these urbanized estuaries through appropriate monitoring programs and modeling applications. However, understanding the nature of estuaries through observation is a long-term mission and a high cost because of the complex fluctuations of tidal estuaries. There is thus currently no universal method for designing water quality monitoring programs that guarantee both spatial and temporal scales for all estuaries <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Hartnett2011">Hartnett, Wilson, and Nash 2011</a>)</span>. Building appropriate water quality monitoring programs that represent estuaries is difficult because of complex pollutant transport patterns at tidal estuaries.

<p>The characteristic feature of estuaries and tidal rivers is the influence of the tides, which usually have two high tides and two low tides, i.e., twice landward and twice seaward flow per day. This has resulted in water quality having a strong fluctuation depending on the hydrological regime. As shown in Figure <a href="literature.html#fig:C1-fig-highresolution">1.15</a>, the survey results of indicators such as salinity, DO, and turbidity fluctuated in intensity and differed between indicators within only 48 hours of the survey. Therefore, high resolution of hydrologic regimes monitoring is essential to understand the variability of water quality in estuaries <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Etcheber2011">Etcheber et al. 2011</a>)</span>.</p>

</h4>
<p>In developing countries, the difficulty in applying water quality modeling to estuaries mainly stems from the required data. As discussed above, emerging countries with inadequate monitoring programs have led to insufficient information to implement estuarine models. Missing data also leads to the inaccurately described biogeochemical processes and pollutant transport of estuaries. The quantity and quality of the data determine the confidence that can be placed on the model application. Uncertainties in external driving forces, such as winds and inflow rates, propagate uncertainties in model results. If the data used for model setup and calibration is not reliable, the results would not be reliable, no matter how well the model was applied to previous studies.</p>
<p>Lack of modelers can be widespread in developing countries. However, the lack of connection between the modeler and the monitoring center is more critical. Failure to apply well documented (e.g., MIKE, a commercial model) can stem from the modeler’s failure to understand the sampling conditions, data uncertainty. Although calibration and validation are based on observed data, no field data should be considered perfectly accurate. Therefore, the difficulty in applying the model in developing countries is from the lack of modelers who can understand internal processes and observation.</p>
<p>In addition, failures in model application leading to wrong decisions in water quality management of estuaries can also be attributed to model selection. Because of the lack of data, it is preferable to use simple models over more complex ones. In particular, simple models often ignore the retention and transformation characteristics over time (e.g., seasonal) of estuaries, which does not detect eutrophication growth or algal blooms over time <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Arndt2009">Sandra Arndt, Regnier, and Vanderborght 2009</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Arndt2011">Sandra Arndt et al. 2011</a>)</span>. Therefore, understanding and using models that accurately describe hydrodynamics and biogeochemical processes are necessary to quantify nutrient dynamics in estuaries and improve management efficiency.</p>

<p>Successful lessons in the management or recovery of estuaries have been observed in many developed countries, where the solution has been used was the reduction of the amount of wastewater entering estuaries <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Wolanski2014">Wolanski and Elliott 2014</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The results of a 40-year survey at the Seine river and estuary (France) have shown the evolution and effectiveness of freshwater quality policies <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Romero2016">Romero et al. 2016</a>)</span>. Two decades ago, the Seine estuary used to have summer anoxic episodes, then the extension of WWTPs and agricultural policies has kept the estuary almost always in good condition since 2010 (Figure <a href="literature.html#fig:C1-Seine">1.17</a>). Besides the construction of WWTPs, policies such as the ban of phosphates in household detergents have also reduced <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{PO_4^{3-}}\)</span> concentrations significantly since the 1990s <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Romero2016">Romero et al. 2016</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of management policies in improving water quality is demonstrated through the stages of development of WWTPs (Figure <a href="literature.html#fig:C1-Seine">1.17</a>). However, the effectiveness of new WWTPs with a suitable capacity to the urbanized tropical estuaries in developing countries is still questionable because of the lack of long-term observation. Besides, <span class="citation">Wolanski and Elliott (<a href="references.html#ref-Wolanski2014">2014</a>)</span> argue that policies to reduce pollution do not always succeed because the consequences of eutrophication can linger when estuaries have lost their purification capacity. <span class="citation">Schindler et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Schindler2008">2008</a>)</span> concluded that eutrophication of lakes could not be controlled by reducing the nitrogen input because this action can increasingly favor nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria; the lake thus remained highly eutrophic. Therefore, the determination of policies to reduce pollution should pay attention to the composition and proportion of nutrients (N, P, Si). The contribution of biogeochemical models for estuaries is critical <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Wolanski2014">Wolanski and Elliott 2014</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In rapidly urbanizing countries, questions about management policies align with megacities’ strong impact to reduce eutrophication in estuaries. Improvements in water quality and control of eutrophication in estuaries are also seen in some of the highly urbanizing countries in Asia. Shenzhen Bay (China) is an example of the impact of urbanization on the water quality of estuaries and coastal areas in the 1990s. Similar to other developing countries, a large amount of WWTP cost constraints for N and P mitigation policies in wastewater would discourage governments of China. Therefore, monitoring programs and biogeochemical models were implemented to find other solutions in improving coastal regions adjacent to Shenzhen Bay, China. The monitoring results showed that phosphorus was the potential limiting nutrient for primary production in this area. Simulation results also showed that improving the P treatment efficiency of WWTP will help reduce eutrophication. In addition, the removal efficiency of P was also higher than N; reducing phosphorus was thus performed first, followed by nitrogen years later. As a result, eutrophication has almost disappeared in this area since 2005 in this bay <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Zhou2020">Zhou et al. 2020</a>)</span>. This experience of urban river restoration at this tropical bay shows that reductions in nutrient concentrations through WWTP are inevitable. The assistance of modeling in the accurate description of biogeochemical processes and eutrophication development is essential. This helps reduce the cost of building WWTPs that meet the region’s demographic trends.</p>

<p>The variation of water quality is mainly governed by (i) the physical transport (e.g., velocity, advection, diffusion/dispersion, settling and burial) and (ii) the biogeochemical processes (e.g., the transformation of nutrients) <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Shanahan1998">Shanahan et al. 1998</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-OKane2003">O’Kane and Regnier 2003</a>)</span>. A water quality model usually includes these components according to the following equation:</p>
<embed src="figures/FullEQ.pdf" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" type="application/pdf"></embed><p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(C, t, x\)</span> pollutant concentration, time, distance, respectively</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(U, D, H\)</span> advection velocity, dispersion coefficient, total water depth, respectively</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(Advection\)</span> accounts for the concentrations of pollutants follow the current movement as it flows downstream (see Figure <a href="literature.html#fig:C1-avection">1.18</a>)</p></li>

</ul>
<p>The hydrodynamic model provides the advection and dispersion components (Figure <a href="literature.html#fig:C1-avection">1.18</a>), including velocity and turbulent diffusion coefficients. Some hydrodynamic models also provide the information of settling velocity to calculate the amount of settling pollutant and burial. The biogeochemical module provides the transformation of pollutants, which describes the rate of substance variations due to biological and chemical processes, which is usually expressed by a Michaelis–Menten equation. Therefore, the estuarine models are usually called reaction-transport models to describe the substances’ behavior according to hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry.</p>

<p>To simulate water quality in estuaries, it is first necessary to determine the physical transport information of the substances. The hydrodynamics model is thus set up first.

</h4>
<p>The water quality model simultaneously uses the information in the hydraulic model (e.g., advection and dispersion) and combines it with the biogeochemical processes equations to obtain the variable concentrations over time and space. Besides biogeochemical reactions, the concentration of substances changes according to other processes such as sorption or exchange with the atmosphere. Although many processes lead to changes in the concentration of substances, a water quality model is always based on the conservation of mass equation principle. The total mass of an element such as C, N or P will remain the same; they only change the chemical formula under the influence of reactions in water, sediment, air. The main processes leading to the change in the concentration of variables are presented in Table <a href="#tab:CH1-table6-process"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>

<p>The water quality models for estuaries have existed for more than 50 years (e.g., <span class="citation">Espey and GH Ward. (<a href="references.html#ref-EspeyNo10">1972</a>)</span>), including simple 0-dimensional models (0D models) to complex 3-dimensional models (3D models). Models can be classified into three categories as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>The apparent zero end-member concentration model:</strong> This was a one-dimensional estuarine model which provided the quantitative estimates of primary productivity, nutrient fluxes in the saline part of the estuary to the point of zero salinity. The limitation was to introduce large errors in estimating the long-term residual constituent flux towards the coastal zone because it ignored all processes taking place in the tidal river <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Kaul1984">Kaul and Froelich 1984</a>)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Box model:</strong> Box models treat the estuary as a single, vertically and horizontally well-mixed box with steady residual hydrodynamic characteristics <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Regnier2013">Pierre Regnier et al. 2013</a>)</span>. These models are still widely used to assess global estuarine dynamics <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Laruelle2009">G. G. Laruelle et al. 2009</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Garnier2010">Josette Garnier et al. 2010</a>)</span>. However, the results of flux calculation in the box models were usually inaccurate because they neglect the transient behavior of the flow and scalar fields <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Regnier2013">Pierre Regnier et al. 2013</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Arndt2009">Sandra Arndt, Regnier, and Vanderborght 2009</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Arndt2011">Sandra Arndt et al. 2011</a>)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reaction-transport models (RTMs):</strong> RTMs describe the coupling of the transport and reaction in the estuaries.

<p>Although water quality modeling for estuaries has greatly improved over time, the adoption of modern models has not always been consistent for many estuaries. In previous decades, mixing diagrams and steady-state box models were often used, but the disadvantage of these models was that they ignored the influence of tides <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Arndt2009">Sandra Arndt, Regnier, and Vanderborght 2009</a>)</span>. As in the synthesis report of <span class="citation">Espey and GH Ward. (<a href="references.html#ref-EspeyNo10">1972</a>)</span> reaction-transport models allowed an accurate description of biogeochemical processes under the complex influence of many factors in estuaries such as tide, requiring time-costly computation. Today the computational limitation is not an important factor, but the lack of applications of reaction-transport models still exists in many developing countries because of insufficient monitoring plans and access to relevant data series <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Regnier2013">Pierre Regnier et al. 2013</a>)</span>. Therefore, selecting or developing appropriate models to apply on a regional or global scale is critical under the great influence of wastewater from emerging countries <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Regnier2013">Pierre Regnier et al. 2013</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Volta2014">C. Volta et al. 2014</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The model selection is an important step for modeling application because no single model can apply for estuaries systems, even with a very advanced model. One model can be applied for the estuarine system if it can reach these criteria:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Whether the model outputs obtain the studied objectives?</p></li>
<li><p>Whether the hydrodynamic processes take into account the tidal regime?</p></li>
<li><p>Which data/parameters are in need for the model?</p></li>
<li><p>Which assumption and limitation of the model?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Table <a href="#tab:CH1-table7-compare"><strong>??</strong></a> compares the usage scope of some well-known estuarine biogeochemical models. According to the data requirement from simple to complex, the order of the models is C-GEM, CONTRASTE, … MIKE, Delft3D. For the not-well monitoring estuarine systems in many tropical estuaries, the C-GEM, CONTRASTE or MOSES models are suitable if the ultimate study’s objective is to qualify the impact of point sources, tide and biogeochemical processes. At the same time, HEM-3D, CAEDYM, MOHID are more suitable for the more complex requirements such as dynamics of phytoplankton groups and species. Although 1D reaction-transport models such as CONTRASTE can describe estuarine biogeochemical dynamics, the data requirement at the boundaries of estuarine systems still needs to ensure that high temporal variability is described. Therefore, reaction-transport models are often applied in intensively monitored estuaries such as Scheldt (Belgium/Netherlands) <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Arndt2009">Sandra Arndt, Regnier, and Vanderborght 2009</a>)</span>.</p>
