<p>Urbanized tropical estuaries are known as hot spots of eutrophication and greenhouse gases (GHGs) in emerging countries. This chapter presents the nutrients, organic carbon, phytoplankton, and greenhouse gases concentrations in the Saigon River Estuary and compares them with other estuaries in different climates. Several internal processes (e.g., nitrification, denitrification, aerobic degradation of organic carbon) are interpreted to identify the main processes affecting water quality and GHGs emissions at urbanized estuaries.</p>
<p>There was a clear separation of nutrients, organic carbon, GHGs, phytoplankton abundance between the urban area and the remaining area of Saigon River because of polluted urban emissions of Ho Chi Minh Megacity (HCMC). The major phytoplankton were diatoms (e.g., <em>Cyclotella</em> cf. <em>meneghiniana, Leptocylindrus danicus</em>), cyanobacteria (e.g., <em>Microcystis</em> spp). The dominance of potentially toxic cyanobacteria in the Saigon River possess health risk to local residents, especially upon the increasing temperature context and nutrient loading into the river in the next decades. Phytoplankton densities in dry season were about 100 times higher than in the rainy season. Calculation of the eutrophication index shows that 30-50% of the Saigon River (based on river length) was in the eutrophic state and 10% was in the hypertrophic state, mainly in the urban section. While the concentrations of nutrients did not differ significantly between the dry and wet seasons, the concentrations of GHGs (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span>) and phytoplankton densities were markedly different.</p>
<p>High eutrophication and phytoplankton abundance may enhance carbon dioxide (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span>) consumption by photosynthesis in the water column. However, the GHGs results at this urbanized estuary were always in supersaturation state. The average concentrations of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> at Saigon River in 2019-2020 were 3174 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 1725 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>gC-<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>, 5.9 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 16.8 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>gC-<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> and 3.0 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 4.8 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>gN-<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>, respectively. Their concentrations were 13 – 18 times, 52 – 332 times, and 9 – 37 times higher than the global mean concentrations of GHGs, respectively. The increase in eutrophication status along the dense urban area was linearly correlated with increased GHGs concentrations. Both nitrification and denitrification resulted in elevated <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> concentrations in this urban area of the estuary. The high concentration of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> was contributed by the high concentration of organic carbon and mineralization process. GHGs fluxes at Saigon River Estuary were comparable to other urbanized estuaries regardless of climatic condition. Control of eutrophication in urbanized estuaries through the implantation of efficient wastewater treatment facilities will effectively mitigate the global warming potential caused by estuarine emissions.</p>

<p>Saigon River Estuary is an urbanized tropical estuary in Southeast Asia. This river receives a large amount of untreated wastewater from Ho Chi Minh megacity (HCMC), resulting in high concentrations of nutrients, organic matter, chlorophyll-a, and oxygen deficiency in the water column. Several studies have revealed that this estuary was experiencing eutrophication in the urban area <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2019">T. T. N.

<p>Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-physical">3.2</a> presents the monitoring data of physico-chemical parameters (temperature, pH, TSS and salinity). The water temperature at Saigon River ranges from about 28<span class="math inline">\(^{\circ}\)</span>C to 33<span class="math inline">\(^{\circ}\)</span>C, the highest temperature is usually in March and April of the dry seasons and the lowest at the end of the rainy season or the beginning of the dry season (December) (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-physical">3.2</a>a). While the temperature did not differ between the three monitoring stations, the pH concentration was significantly different between Phu Cuong station (PC) and Bach Dang station (BD), Binh Khanh station (BK) with lower pH concentration at PC. The lower pH at PC shows that this area is slightly acidic (pH &lt; 7). There was no difference in pH between BD and BK stations with a range from 6 to 7.5 and no difference between rainy and dry seasons. The pH levels at PC, BD and BK are 6.5, 6.8 and 6.8, respectively.</p>
<p>TSS concentrations ranged from about 20 mgTSS<span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> to more than 300 mgTSS<span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-physical">3.2</a>c). The evolution of TSS at all three stations is usually not seasonal, however in general TSS concentration at PC - upstream is the lowest. The mean TSS concentrations at PC, BD and BK were 32, 95 and 75 mgTSS<span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>, respectively.</p>

While DO was not significantly different between PC and BK, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> concentration depicted this distinct phenomenon. The <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> concentration at BK was only about 0.1 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 0.1 <span class="math inline">\(mgNL^{-1}\)</span>, while the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> concentrations at PC and BD were 0.5 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 0.2 and 0.7 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 0.5 <span class="math inline">\(mgNL^{-1}\)</span>, respectively. During the 5 years of monitoring, the concentration of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> at BD exceeded 2 <span class="math inline">\(mgNL^{-1}\)</span> four times, the remaining time periods were lower than 1 <span class="math inline">\(mgNL^{-1}\)</span> (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-chemical">3.3</a>b).</p>
<p>While BK- downstream has the lowest concentration of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span>, the lowest concentration of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_{3}^{-}}\)</span> was observed at PC - upstream, reaching about 0.2 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 0.2 <span class="math inline">\(mgNL^{-1}\)</span>.

At the BD station, hypertrophic status (8–10) was determined during the wet season of 2015, 2020 and summer 2017. The remaining time, urban sections of Saigon River were mainly mesotrophic (4–6) and eutrophic (6–8) stages.</p>

<p>The HCA on phytoplankton densities during the dry season shown three major site groups in which phytoplankton community and densities were closely similar: SG01-SG04, SG05-SG12 and SG13-SG18 (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-HCA">3.6</a>). It also illustrated a higher similarity of phytoplankton’s characteristics between two groups SG01-SG04 and SG05-SG12, than downstream group (SG13-SG18). Three groups were identified during the rainy season: SG01-SG07, SG08-SG12 and SG13-SG18 (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-HCA">3.6</a>). Unlike HCA for the dry season, the similarity in phytoplankton compositions in the rainy season at upstream SG01 stretched to SG07, which is located in the urban area of HCMC. The close similarity of phytoplankton’s characteristics among the sites SG13-SG18 was comparable between the dry and the rainy seasons and had the most difference with the two groups in the upstream and urban areas. In general, HCA results show that phytoplankton composition and densities along the Saigon River varied along three sections of Saigon River (i) upstream, (ii) urban area and (iii) downstream of HCMC. The temporal variation of phytoplankton communities at these sections will be analyzed in turn based on bi-weekly monitoring over a year at three representative sites (SG01, SG10 and SG18).</p>

<p>The dominant phytoplankton communities identified along the two longitudinal profiles are presented in Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-profile">3.7</a>. It consisted in mainly species of diatoms (e.g., <em>Cyclotella</em> cf<em>. meneghiniana</em>, <em>Leptocylindrus danicus</em> Cleve 1889, <em>Synedra</em> sp, <em>Amphiprora</em> sp, <em>Aulacoseira granulata</em> (Ehrenberg) Simonsen 1979 , <em>Nitzschia</em> cf<em>. palea</em>; <em>Navicula</em> sp), cyanobacteria (e.g., <em>Raphidiopsis raciborskii</em> (Woloszynska) Aguilera et al. 2018, <em>Microcystis</em> spp, <em>Pseudanabaena</em> sp, <em>Dolichospermum</em> sp, <em>Oscillatoria</em> sp), green algae (e.g, <em>Scenedesmus acuminatus</em> (Lagerheim) Chodat 1902), and euglenoids (e.g., <em>Euglena</em> sp, <em>Trachelomonas</em> <em>volvocina</em> (Ehrenberg) Ehrenberg 1834) (Table <a href="#tab:C2-table1-domiant"><strong>??</strong></a>).</p>

<p>The longitudinal profiles along the Saigon River revealed contrasted phytoplankton densities, varying from 48,200 to 5,296,000 individuals <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> during the dry season (April 2017) and from 1,400 to 35,120 individuals <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> during the rainy season (October 2017) (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-profile">3.7</a>). During the dry season, the phytoplankton densities shown a similar range of lower densities (&lt; 0.5 million individuals <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>) in upstream (SG01-SG04) and downstream (SG11-SG18), but they drastically increased up to around 5.0 million individuals <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> from SG05 to SG10. In contrast, during the rainy season longitudinal profile, there was no sudden increase in phytoplankton densities, but they gradually increased from SG01 to SG14 and decreased in downstream of Saigon River (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-profile">3.7</a>b). Beside the significant difference in phytoplankton densities between dry and rainy seasons (lower than 100 times), the dominant species along the Saigon River also differed between the two distinct seasons. The dominant phytoplankton species in dry season longitudinal profile were <em>Leptocylindru</em>s <em>danicus</em> (SG01 to SG04, km 0 to km 13) and <em>Cyclotella</em> cf. <em>meneghiniana</em> (SG05 to SG18, km 17 to km 61) (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-profile">3.7</a>a, Table <a href="#tab:C2-table1-domiant"><strong>??</strong></a>). The dominant species in rainy season longitudinal profile were <em>Trachelomonas volvocina</em> (SG01 to SG12, km 0 to km 45), <em>Raphidiopsis raciborskii</em> (SG13 to SG15, km 49 to km 53), and <em>Microcystis</em> spp., <em>Psedudanabaena</em> sp (SG13 to SG18).</p>

<p>The phytoplankton communities at the three sampling sites (SG01; SG10; SG18) are presented in Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-season">3.8</a>. The dominant phytoplankton species, genera and their densities varied among the sites and were globally characterized by: diatoms, (e.g. <em>A. granulata, Navicula</em> spp., <em>L. danicus</em>, <em>Cyclotella</em> cf. <em>meneghiniana</em>), cyanobacteria (e.g. <em>Microcystis</em> sp., <em>R. raciborskii, Pseudanabaena</em> sp.) green algae (e.g. <em>S. acuminatus</em>), euglenoids, (e.g. <em>T. volvocina</em>) and dinoflagellates (e.g. <em>Peridinium</em> sp.) (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-season">3.8</a>). A high correlation between total phytoplankton density and chlorophyll-<em>a</em> at SG01 (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{R^2}\)</span>= 0.91) and SG10 (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{R^2}\)</span>= 0.93) was observed (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-season">3.8</a>). The phytoplankton densities varied between sites with several orders of magnitude, from 400–327,500 individuals <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> at SG01, 9,330–2,733,000 individuals <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> at SG10, and 1,360–45,700 individuals <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> at SG18 (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-season">3.8</a>). At SG01, the densities were elevated in March and April 2017 (mainly <em>L. danicus</em> and <em>A. granulata</em>) and very low (&lt; 50,000 individuals <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>) the rest of the survey (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-season">3.8</a>a).

At SG18 – downstream of Saigon River, there was no significant difference in phytoplankton density between rainy and dry seasons (p&gt; 0.1). Phytoplankton densities were the highest during two periods, from January to March 2017 (mainly <em>C. meneghiniana</em>) and from June to November 2017 (mainly <em>Microcystis</em> spp), and lower than 10,000 individuals <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> the rest of the year (mainly <em>L. danicus</em>, <em>Pseudanabaena</em> sp and <em>R. raciborskii</em>).</p>

<p>Based on bi-weekly monitoring data at SG01, SG10 and SG18, the PCA was used to identify the various patterns of environmental parameters and similarities between upstream, urban area and downstream sections of the Saigon River. The PCA results could be used to identify the impact of urban discharge on the phytoplankton biomass, supported by the high correlation of Chl-a and phytoplankton abundances (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{R^2}\)</span>= 0.9, Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-season">3.8</a>). Similar to the HCA results on phytoplankton abundances along the Saigon River, the PCA results on environmental parameters separate the three monitoring locations (SG01, SG10 and SG18) (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-PCA">3.9</a>). The PCA results shown that the water quality in SG10 suffered from the most diverse environmental parameters (TSS, TOC, nutrients, Chl-<em>a</em> and dissolved metals), which were mainly related to pollution from the urban area of HCMC. During the dry season, the first principal component (PC1) mainly represented metal, pH and salinity variables mainly linked to SG18 (downstream section) (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-PCA">3.9</a>). In PC2 of the dry season and PC1 of the rainy season, the most important variables were the nutrients, TOC, Chl-a, which are associated with SG10 (urban section of the Saigon River). This illustrated that the urban area was affected by urban discharges containing high pollutant concentrations from the connecting canals and creeks during both seasons.</p>

Only abundances of <em>L. danicus</em>, <em>Cyclotella</em> cf. <em>meneghiniana</em>, <em>Microcystis</em> spp, <em>Eunotia</em> sp had a clear relationship with environmental parameters while other dominant species (mainly in rainy season) such as <em>Peridinium</em> sp, <em>A.</em> <em>granulata</em>, <em>T.</em> <em>volvocina</em>, <em>R. raciborskii, Pseudanabaena</em> sp have not been explained by RDA. It is noticed that even though total phytoplankton abundance in the Saigon River was highly correlated with phytoplankton biomass (assessed by chlorophyll <em>a</em>), the use of phytoplankton abundances had some limitations in assessing ecological relationship because some phytoplankton species, with lower densities, did not have a high correlation with chlorophyll <em>a</em> such as <em>R. raciborskii</em>, <em>Peridinium sp</em>.</p>

<p>During the dry season, the abundance of <em>Cyclotella</em> cf. <em>meneghiniana</em> was related with pH, salinity, TN, DIN, Chl-a, Mn, Mg and Mo (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-RDA">3.10</a>a). This indicates that the majority of <em>Cyclotella</em> cf. <em>meneghiniana</em> abundance contributed to the biomass of Chl-a measured at the urban area of the Saigon River. While Mn plays an important role in the photosynthesis, Mg is an essential element in algal cellular proliferation which reduces the loss of chlorophyll pigments <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Bogorad1966">Bogorad 1966</a>)</span>. Therefore, the increase of Mn and Mg in the urban area could support the growth of phytoplankton in the Saigon River. However, according to the longitudinal profile during the dry season, there was no difference in Mn, Mg concentrations between at SG04 and SG05, while diatom abundance suddenly increased from about 500,000 to 4,000,000 ind <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>. <em>Cyclotella</em> cf. <em>meneghiniana</em> became the highest densely phytoplankton, replacing <em>L</em>. <em>danicus</em> at SG05. Therefore, the metals (Mn and Mg) were not factors leading to the predominance of <em>Cyclotella</em> cf. <em>meneghiniana</em> in the Saigon River. Relationship between <em>Cyclotella</em> cf. <em>meneghiniana</em> and salinity clarified this phenomenon. The salinity intrusion of the Saigon River during the dry season was about 90-100 km from the estuary mouth (SG05-SG06), the salinity reached a maximum of about 0.5 during the dry season at SG05. Therefore, the salinity at SG04 was rarely greater than zero. This interesting finding shown that freshwater diatom <em>Cyclotella</em> cf. <em>meneghiniana</em> can also dominate in non-zero salinity areas (urban area and downstream section). The second dominant diatom in the Saigon River, <em>L. danicus</em> was not associated with nutrients but with TOC and inversely correlated with <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{DSi}\)</span> and Mg. The silicate is a macronutrient for diatoms because it is the main component of the frustules of diatoms <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Wetzel2001">Wetzel 2001</a>)</span>. However, it is out of our expectation that there was no correlation between diatoms and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{DSi}\)</span>. The sufficient levels of silicate in the Saigon River (&gt; 0.5 mg <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>) helps to explain the lack of this relationship <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2019">T. T. N. Nguyen, Némery, Gratiot, Strady, et al. 2019</a>)</span>. Besides that, the increase of Mg concentration from SG01 to SG18 (1224 to 14092 <span class="math inline">\(\mu g\)</span><span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>) has led <em>Cyclotella</em> cf. <em>meneghiniana</em> outgrown <em>L. danicus</em> which fell sharply at SG18. <em>Leptocylindrus danicus</em> and TOC were positively linked in this study because high phytoplankton abundance contributed to the TOC in surface water, as previously stated in <span class="citation">H.-Q. Nguyen, Ha, and Pham (<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2020c">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>During the rainy season, RDA results generally show that diatom densities (<em>Cyclotella</em> cf. <em>meneghiniana</em>, <em>L. danicus</em>) were positively related to variance of TOC, nutrients (DIN, TN, DIP) and metals (Mn, Mo, Co). The positive relationship of phytoplankton divisions with nitrogen and phosphorus compounds in this study is supported by previous investigations <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Varol2018">Varol and Sen 2018</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Liu2020">Liu et al. 2020</a>)</span>. The abundance of <em>Eunotia</em> sp. during the rainy season was highly related with the Cu, Zn, Co concentrations but negatively related with pH. This species might be sensitive lower concentration of pH in SG01 where the pH was about 6.2 – 6.4. This was in contrast to <em>Cyclotella</em> cf. <em>meneghiniana</em> or <em>L. danicus</em> that dominated at SG10 (pH range 6.7 - 6.8). This result shows that the small difference in pH between upstream (SG01) and urban area (SG10) may result in the change of dominant species along the Saigon River.</p>

<p>In the longitudinal profiles along the Saigon River (SG01 - SG18) and during the bi-weekly monitoring (SG01, SG10 and SG18), we found significant difference of phytoplankton’s characteristics between the urban area and the upstream and downstream parts of HCMC (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-profile">3.7</a>), suggesting influence of localized environmental factors. The phytoplankton abundance in the urban area were much higher than in upstream and downstream of Saigon River. The phytoplankton abundances at SG01 and SG18 (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-season">3.8</a>a, c) were within the range of the phytoplankton abundances in the Vam Co River (an affluent of the downstream Saigon River) 920 – 383,600 individuals <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Dao2016">Dao and Bui 2016</a>)</span>. During the dry season longitudinal profile, the diatom <em>L. danicus,</em> a brackish water species, was dominated at the first four sites, SG01-SG04, which could be related to the slight increase of salinity up to SG01 observed at these stations and could support the conditions for the occurrence and out competition of this diatom to other phytoplankton. The freshwater species (except <em>L. danicus –</em> a brackish diatom) dominated during the dry period in March and April 2017 at the site SG01, which is coherent with the freshwater characteristic (salinity ~ 0) nearly all year around at the site SG01. The abundance of phytoplankton at SG10 during the dry season was around 10 and 100 times higher than that at SG01 and SG18, respectively (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-season">3.8</a>). These results were comparable with the phytoplankton abundance in the Tigris and Paraguay Rivers which have been also under effect of anthropogenic pressures <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Domitrovic2002">Domitrovic 2002</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Varol2018">Varol and Sen 2018</a>)</span>. At SG10, the dominance of <em>Cyclotella</em> cf. <em>meneghiniana</em> and <em>L. danicus</em> could be driven by environmental parameters such as salinity, trace elements (e.g. Mo, Mn) and high concentrations of nutrients from urban discharge. <span class="citation">Dao and Bui (<a href="references.html#ref-Dao2016">2016</a>)</span> also observed the dominance of diatoms (<em>Cyclotella</em> spp and <em>Eunotia</em> spp) in the surface waters of Vam Co River (15 km from Saigon River Estuary mouth), which is in accordance with the dominance of diatoms species (e.g. <em>Navicula</em> sp.<em>, A. granulata, Cyclotella</em> cf. <em>meneghiniana,</em> and <em>L. danicus)</em> in our study (Table <a href="#tab:C2-table1-domiant"><strong>??</strong></a>).</p>
<p>Unlike upstream and urban area of HCMC, phytoplankton abundance was quite low in the downstream of HCMC (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-profile">3.7</a>) and dominated by both diatoms (<em>Cyclotella</em> cf. <em>meneghiniana</em>) and cyanobacteria (e.g. <em>Microcystis</em> spp, <em>Pseudanabaena</em> sp, <em>Raphidiopsis raciborskii</em>) (Table <a href="#tab:C2-table1-domiant"><strong>??</strong></a>). The site SG16 is the meeting point of the Saigon and Dongnai Rivers, and the water discharge of the Dongnai River is around 12 times higher than the one of the Saigon River <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2019">T. T. N. Nguyen, Némery, Gratiot, Strady, et al. 2019</a>)</span>. The phytoplankton community and abundance would thus be much more influenced by the water from the Dongnai River than by water from the Saigon River at site SG18. Proliferation and bloom forming of cyanobacteria have been commonly observed in the Tri An Reservoir, upstream of the Dongnai River <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Dao2016">Dao and Bui 2016</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2020c">H.-Q.

Therefore, the commonly presence and dominance of cyanobacteria (Table <a href="#tab:C2-table1-domiant"><strong>??</strong></a>) especially at SG18 (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-season">3.8</a>c) could result of (i) the consequence of the diffusion of waters enriched with cyanobacteria, from Tri An Reservoir <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2020c">H.-Q.

Nguyen et al. 2021</a>)</span>. High load of nutrients from HCMC and long residence time may strongly enhance the phytoplankton development during the dry season in the urban section of the Saigon River. <span class="citation">Ferreira et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Ferreira2005">2005</a>)</span> found that higher phytoplankton biomass is more prevalent in estuaries with long residence time even without anthropogenic impact. However, during the rainy season, stronger water discharge from upstream of the Saigon River had shorten residence time of water body. This leads to a decrease of phytoplankton development before being flushed out of the estuary during the rainy season. The seasonal variation in phytoplankton abundance in the Saigon River has also been found in other tropical estuaries such as Bach Dang Estuary (Vietnam) <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-vanChu2014">van Chu et al. 2014</a>)</span>, Red River (Vietnam) <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Duong2019">Duong, Hoang, et al. 2019</a>)</span> and Paciencia River Estuary (Brazil) <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Cavalcanti2020">Cavalcanti et al. 2020</a>)</span>. During the dry season<em>, L.</em> <em>danicus</em> and <em>A. granulata</em> were dominant in upstream of HCMC (SG01), while the freshwater algae <em>Peridinium</em> was dominant there in rainy season. At SG10, there was the dominance of another freshwater species (<em>T. volvocina</em>) beside the dominance of <em>Cyclotella</em> cf. <em>meneghiniana</em> and <em>L. danicus</em> (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-season">3.8</a>). The appearance of freshwater algae could be due to the prevention of saline intrusion supported by the high discharge in the rainy season. This could also be related to the Saigon River morphometry, which is very deep at this location (&gt; 12 m), and has a lower water current locally, freshwater algae from inland, and eutrophic canals and creeks connecting to the river.</p>
<p>During the rainy season longitudinal profile, the similarity of phytoplankton characteristics among the sites did not clearly separate as in dry season (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-profile">3.7</a>). This may be linked with the higher water discharge upstream of Saigon River during the rainy season, resulting in the influence of inland water down to the urban area. The supporting evidences for this hypothesis are that (i) there was not a significant increase of phytoplankton abundance along Saigon River (max of 35,120 ind <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>), and (ii) typical inland algae (<em>T. volvocina</em>; Reynolds, 2006) dominated during the rainy season longitudinal profile. Besides, the dominance of the freshwater species of <em>T. volvocina</em> and <em>Pseudanabaena</em> sp. at the site urban section of Saigon River by the end of the rainy season (Oct, Nov 2017) is supported by the dominance of <em>T. volvocina</em> at 12 sites during the rainy season (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-profile">3.7</a>). The euglenoids <em>Trachelomonas</em> and dinoflagellates <em>Peridinium</em> are typical genera of nutrient enrich trophic lakes observed in the Saigon River.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy difference is the formation of cyanobacterial species during the rainy season. Bi-weekly monitoring and longitudinal profile during rainy season both detected cyanobacterium <em>Microcystis</em> spp and <em>R</em>. <em>raciborskii</em> in the downstream of the Saigon River. While <em>Microcystis</em> spp could have originated from Tri An Reservoir <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Dao2016">Dao and Bui 2016</a>)</span>, Cyanobacterium <em>R. raciborskii</em> may be related to the high TSS concentrations in the downstream area during the rainy season. Some cyanobacterial species such as <em>R. raciborskii</em> and <em>Microcystis</em> spp. have air aerotopes in their cells, giving them a buoyant capacity to surfaceater <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Mhlanga2006">Mhlanga et al. 2006</a>)</span>. The cyanobacterium <em>R. raciborskii</em> has a filamentous form which helps to capture more light in turbid waters <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Reynolds2006">Reynolds 2006</a>)</span>. Therefore, the species <em>R. raciborskii</em> could withstand the low radiation in water column in high TSS conditions and maintain their normal photosynthesis activities in topwater.</p>

<p>The spatial distributions of the GHGs in dry and rainy seasons in the Saigon River are illustrated in Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-gas-flux">3.12</a>. In general, GHGs tended to increase gradually in the urban section and to decrease downstream.

The difference in <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> concentration between the two seasons was about 30%, with a higher <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> concentration in the rainy season. <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> concentrations were 0.6 – 3.6 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>gC <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> (mean 1.8 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 1.1) and 0.9 – 117 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>gC <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> (mean 11.3 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 22.7) respectively, meaning that the concentration of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> in the dry season was about seven times lower than in the rainy season. <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 20.1 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>gN <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> (mean 4.6 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 6.2) in dry season and from 0.0 to 2.9 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>gN <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> (mean 1.2 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 0.9) in rainy season.

<p>The high supersaturation values of GHGs suggest that this tropical estuary contributed significantly to GHGs emissions. With the normalized gas transfer velocity of 12.3 cm <span class="math inline">\(h^{-1}\)</span> (10 - 18 cm <span class="math inline">\(h^{-1}\)</span>), the mean density fluxes of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> in the Saigon River were 31870 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 11224, 26.5 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 42.5 mg C <span class="math inline">\(m^{-2}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span> and 26.0 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 29.6 mg N <span class="math inline">\(m^{-2}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span>. Similar to the concentrations of GHGs (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-gas-flux">3.12</a>), the distribution of GHGs fluxes varied between the upstream and downstream sections of the Saigon River and between the rainy and dry seasons. During the dry season, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> fluxes were higher in the upstream (about 78000 mgC <span class="math inline">\(m^{-2}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span> at UP03 in 2020) and much lower in the estuary mouth (about 1700 mgC <span class="math inline">\(m^{-2}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span> at SG23). <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> flux decreases gradually from about 8 mgC <span class="math inline">\(m^{-2}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span> in the upstream and urban section to about 5 mgC <span class="math inline">\(m^{-2}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span> in the estuary mouth. <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> flux was the highest at urban section SG05 (5km landward from an urban canal) with 341 mgN <span class="math inline">\(m^{-2}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span> and undersaturated at estuary mouth with -1.5 mgN <span class="math inline">\(m^{-2}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> fluxes in the upstream section did not differ significantly between the two seasons, while the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> flux in the urban section in the rainy season was about 1.5 times higher than in the dry season. The higher <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> flux tended to move further downstream in the rainy season, compared to the dry season. The <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> flux at the estuary mouth thus reached more than 18000 mgC <span class="math inline">\(m^{-2}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span>, about 10 times higher than in the dry season. <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> fluxes reached the highest level in urban section with up to 466 mgC <span class="math inline">\(m^{-2}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(d^{-1}\)</span> in SG07, where urban wastewater is directly discharged. It is about 70 times higher than <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> fluxes values observed in upstream and downstream sections. In contrast to <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span>, there was no increase of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> flux in the urban section in the rainy season but instead, a decrease (about ten times) compared to the dry season.

<p>GHGs in the Saigon River Estuary were supersaturated, indicating that this tropical urbanized estuary is a source of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span>), <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> to the atmosphere during both seasons. We compared our present GHGs concentrations and associated fluxes between Saigon River with other subtropical and temperate systems experiencing different environmental conditions (Table <a href="#tab:C3-GHGs-compare"><strong>??</strong></a>). In addition, the emission fluxes of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> were converted to <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> equivalents to evaluate the total impact of GHGs on global warming potential. Overall, this comparison shows that the concentrations/fluxes of GHGs in the estuaries, heavily affected by emissions from urbanization, industry, and agriculture, were much higher than other areas, whatever the climatic region considered, revealing that anthropogenic activity is the main driver.</p>
<p>GHGs concentrations in the Saigon River were at the same level as in other urbanized estuaries such as Nanfei River, China, <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Zhang2021">W. Zhang et al. 2021</a>)</span>, Zambezi River, Africa <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Teodoru2015">Teodoru et al. 2015</a>)</span>, Guadalete Estuary, Spain, <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Burgos2015">M.

Zambezi River had TOC concentration of about 5.8 mgC<span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>, close to the 5.2 mgC<span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> of the Saigon River. The <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> concentrations of the two systems in their urban areas were similar, but the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> concentration in the Zambezi River was about two times higher while the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> concentration was about 10 times smaller than that of the Saigon River. Similarly, the Indian Adyar River, highly polluted because of untreated domestic wastewater in Chennai city, also shown high <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> and low <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> concentrations <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-NirmalRajkumar2008">Rajkumar et al. 2008</a>)</span>. The high <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> and low <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> concentrations were also observed in the urban area of Saigon River in the rainy season (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-gas-flux">3.12</a>). Based on <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> equivalents calculation, the reduction of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> will contribute more efficiently to the reduction in global warming potential than the reduction of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span>. Therefore, controlling the concentration of nutrients in wastewater and in the river can be thus considered in priority to improve the effectiveness of reducing global warming.</p>
<p>Concentrations of GHGs in non-urban estuaries can be about 10-100 times lower than in urbanized estuaries, especially for <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span>. The rivers, peat-dominated or mangrove-dominated regions (e.g., <span class="citation">B. Hu et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Hu2018">2018</a>)</span>; <span class="citation">Müller et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Muller2016">2016</a>)</span>; <span class="citation">Reithmaier et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Reithmaier2020">2020</a>)</span>) revealed low GHGs concentrations regardless of climatic region (tropical or temperate estuaries). This may suggest that despite the existence of higher rates of nitrification and aerobic/anaerobic respiration in tropical/subtropical estuaries than in temperate estuaries, linked to high temperature, these rates might be masked by polluted water from urban discharge. For example, Guadalete Estuary (Spain), an urban estuary in a south Mediterranean region and Po River (Italy) with continental temperate climate still had <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span>), <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> concentrations several times higher than the peat-dominated river of the tropical region in Malaysia. Moreover, the Po River (Italy) under the impact of nitrate pollution can lead to <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> concentrations/fluxes much higher than the ones in urbanized tropical estuaries such as Saigon River (Vietnam), Adyar River (India).</p>

<p>Several studies determined <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> production by nitrification process based on a linear relationship between <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> excess (<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span>xs, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> supersaturation) and apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) (e.g., <span class="citation">Nevison, Butler, and Elkins (<a href="references.html#ref-Nevison2003">2003</a>)</span>; <span class="citation">Santoro et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Santoro2021">2021</a>)</span>; <span class="citation">Brase et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Brase2017">2017</a>)</span>). We explored such a linear relationship in upstream and downstream of Saigon River in the dry season. These positive correlations are indicative of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{O_{2}}\)</span> consumption linked to <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> production. Therefore, most of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> production in upstream, downstream sections and some parts in the urban area of HCMC was mainly derived from nitrification/nitrifier denitrification processes, as shown by a modeling approach we applied in previous work <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2021">A. T. Nguyen et al. 2021</a>)</span>. We also observed a break of linearity with the highest <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> supersaturation values at the highest AOU (i.e. low DO condition) in the urban stretch of Saigon River (SG04 – SG07 with <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O_{xs}}\)</span> of 4.5 – 35 <span class="math inline">\(\mu gNL^{-1}\)</span>, Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-AOU-N2O">3.13</a>a). The broken linear relationship of AOU and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span>xs was mainly observed at highly urbanized estuaries, which provide the most intense <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> production, supported by the denitrification process <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Murray2015">Murray, Erler, and Eyre 2015</a>)</span>. Besides, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> emissions in the estuarine system are generally higher due to the propensity of nitrifying bacteria to attach onto suspended particulates, supporting high activities due to their longer residence times than the water itself <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Brion2000">Brion et al. 2000</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Murray2015">Murray, Erler, and Eyre 2015</a>)</span>. There were some stations in urban areas aligned with the AOU-<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span>xs slope in upstream and downstream stations. We hypothesized that the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> in these locations could be the result of nitrification/nitrifier denitrification (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-AOU-N2O">3.13</a>a).</p>
<p>Besides nitrifier denitrification, the combined nitrification and denitrification under moderate oxygen conditions (1–2 mg<span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>) in the urban area of Saigon River might also explain the higher increase in <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> than in the upstream and downstream areas. <span class="citation">Bie et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Bie2002">2002</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Murray, Erler, and Eyre (<a href="references.html#ref-Murray2015">2015</a>)</span> found that at intermediate <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{O_{2}}\)</span> saturation with high concentrations of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span>, estuaries can produce a large amount of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> by the coupled nitrification and denitrification. in the Saigon River, this can be supported by the dominance of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> in DIN. Nevertheless, the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span>xs vs. AOU relationship does not allow calculating the proportion of nitrification, nitrifier denitrification or denitrification contributing to <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> production <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nevison2003">Nevison, Butler, and Elkins 2003</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In rainy season in contrast, the linear relationship <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O_{xs}}\)</span> vs. AOU was broken at the lowest <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O_{xs}}\)</span>. The maximum <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O_{xs}}\)</span>in the urban area in rainy season was 10 – 20 times lower than in the dry season (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-AOU-N2O">3.13</a>). The oxygen depletion in the urban and downstream sectors was much higher (a difference of about 2 mg <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>) than in the dry season caused by organic matter inputs from bottom sediment of the canals and the river, and edges (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-gas-profile">3.11</a>). The slope of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span>xs vs AOU in the upstream stations was lower than for the dry season despite higher ammonium substrate, but it would also indicate nitrification in this period. In the urban sector, high TOC level with the low oxygenation (0.5 – 1.0 mg<span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> in the urban canals, Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-gas-profile">3.11</a>) would promote denitrification as shown by the decrease in nitrate. Denitrification was even complete, as shown by the null values of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-AOU-N2O">3.13</a>b). The <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> production by nitrification in the downstream sector in rainy season was weaker than in dry season (i.e. the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span>xs/AOU slope was less steep) even with similar <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> concentrations. The lower temperature, together with a high dilution in rainy season, might account for the lower activities of nitrifying bacteria. However, the difference in <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> concentration downstream between the two seasons was not significant.</p>

<p>Based on the phytoplankton respiration equation <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Redfield1963">Redfield, B. H. Ketchum, and F. A.

In dry season, our study’s ratios of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}_{xs}\)</span>/AOU were 0.7 – 1.0 mainly in urban and downstream sections, 1.1 – 1.6 in the upstream and some parts of urban area (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-AOU-CO2">3.14</a>). The respiration quotient was close to the range of theoretical Redfield respiration, indicating that aerobic respiration was the main factor producing <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> in most urban areas and downstream. Meanwhile, potentially lateral inputs of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> or another internal process might occur in upper parts of urban and upstream sections because of higher <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}_{xs}\)</span>/AOU quotient (&gt;1.0) <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Smith2017">R.

<p>Similar to AOU-<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span>xs (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-AOU-CO2">3.14</a>), extreme supersaturations of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> in the AOU-<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}_{xs}\)</span> were distributed in the areas with the lowest DO concentration (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-AOU-CH4">3.15</a>b). However, no correlation was found based on AOU-<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}_{xs}\)</span> analysis for the Saigon River. This result confirmed that high oxygen utilization (AOU) in this urbanized estuary was not conducive to <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> oxidation in the water column.

This study suggested that nitrifiers outcompeted the methanotroph community because of the strong nitrification process. Indeed, the analysis of AOU-<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}_{xs}\)</span> (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-AOU-N2O">3.13</a>) and AOU-<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}_{xs}\)</span> (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-AOU-CO2">3.14</a>) shown that DO concentration in the water column was affected by oxic respiration and nitrification, leading to DO depletion in the Saigon River. Our result differs from the studies of <span class="citation">Bui and Thi Ngoc Oanh (<a href="references.html#ref-Buioanh2018">2018</a>)</span> or <span class="citation">Sierra et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Sierra2020b">2020</a>)</span> which observed a negative correlation between AOU-<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}_{xs}\)</span>, indicating a <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> decrease by methane oxidation in aerobic conditions.

Therefore, we applied multivariate statistical analysis (RDA and HP methods) on the environmental variables and GHGs to identify their relationship and assess the impact of urban discharge on GHGs production (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-RDA-HP">3.16</a>).</p>

<p>Overall, the ten parameters (physio-chemical parameters, nutrients, eutrophication indicators) accounted for about 80% of the variation of GHGs in both seasons. The two axes of RDA1 and RDA2 contributed nearly 70% to the interpretation of GHGs and about 30% of the unexplained variation (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-RDA-HP">3.16</a>). A stepwise selection was applied after running RDA to help remove non-significant explanatory variables. As a result, there were five explanatory variables, including DO, TSS, TOC, Chl-a and TRIX in the dry season. During the rainy season, the results of RDA determined the impact of DO, TSS, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span>, alkalinity and salinity on GHGs concentrations.</p>

</h4>
<p>Several studies found that anthropogenic inputs (with high DIN concentration) correlated significantly with <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> production (e.g., <span class="citation">Murray, Erler, and Eyre (<a href="references.html#ref-Murray2015">2015</a>)</span>; <span class="citation">Marescaux, Thieu, and Garnier (<a href="references.html#ref-Marescaux2018">2018</a>)</span>; <span class="citation">Macarena Burgos, Ortega, and Forja (<a href="references.html#ref-Burgos2017">2017</a>)</span>). These findings suggested that most eutrophic and polluted estuaries would probably experience an <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> supersaturation <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Manjrekar2020">Manjrekar, Uskaikar, and Morajkar 2020</a>)</span>. However, there was no linear correlation between <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_{3}^{-}}\)</span> in the Saigon River, which received a large number of nutrients from urban discharge.</p>
<p>Based on the RDA results, TOC, Chl-a and eutrophication index had strong relationships with the variation of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> concentration in dry season in the Saigon River (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-RDA-HP">3.16</a>a). High concentrations of pollutants and heavy eutrophication help explain such high concentrations of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span>. In rainy season, dissolved <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> was not detected in both the urban area and downstream of Saigon River, despite the nutrient concentrations were even higher than in dry season (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-gas-profile">3.11</a>). During the rainy season, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> concentrations did not correlate with nutrient concentrations. Instead, alkalinity contributed to 53% to the variation of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span>. In dry period, the impact of urban wastewater (high TOC, low DO concentrations, eutrophication) corresponds to an increase in <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> concentration in the receiving urban area, with alkalinity supporting ammonium oxidation, and hence <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> production <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Peng2015">Peng et al. 2015</a>)</span>. The alkalinity concentration in dry season is higher than in rainy season, but in low concentration (50 mgCaCO3<span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>). Based on the statistical approach, the contribution of alkalinity was not enough to explain the significant decrease of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> from dry season to rainy season in urban area of Saigon River. Eutrophication was the factor having the most significant impact on <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> in this study. TRIX or Chl-a was significantly correlated with <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> during the dry season. From upstream (UP01) to urban area (SG05), Chl-a concentration increased steadily from 0.5 to 15 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>g<span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> concentration also increased from about 2 to 30 <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>gN <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-gas-profile">3.11</a>). This result was similar to previous studies with the confirmation of the effect on eutrophication on <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> production in rivers and estuaries; e.g, Rivière du Nord in Canada <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Galantini2021">Galantini, Lapierre, and Maranger 2021</a>)</span>, Xiaoyue River in China <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Wang2020">J.

<p>Studies dealing with the impact of urbanization on <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> production shown that the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> concentration was higher in the rivers with higher urban coverage <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Tang2021">Tang, Jun Xu, and Li 2021</a>)</span>. In the Saigon River, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> concentrations were supersaturated in both seasons even if its concentration significantly decreased in the downstream section of the estuary (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-gas-profile">3.11</a>).</p>
<p>RDA and HP analysis results show that DO was linked to <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> concentration in the Saigon River (&gt;20% independent effects) in both seasons. The DO concentrations frequently ranging from moderate to severe hypoxic conditions (0.5 mg <span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>), while dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was maintained at a concentration of 3.6 <span class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 1.1 mgC<span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>. In other words, the Saigon River shown all the conditions (polluted and anoxic states, anaerobic/anoxic processes) for decomposing organic carbon and depleting oxygen and producing <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2019">T. T. N. Nguyen, Némery, Gratiot, Strady, et al. 2019</a>)</span>. In general, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> concentration in both seasons tended to decrease gradually along the estuarine gradient (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-gas-profile">3.11</a>) due to the dilution effect. However, compared to global atmospheric <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> concentration, the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> downstream of Saigon River was 2-4 times higher (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-gas-profile">3.11</a>). The Can Gio mangrove at the interface of Saigon River and the coastal zone was considered as a source of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> to the atmosphere, with the highest emissions near the inflowing river. <span class="citation">David et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-David2018">2018</a>)</span> concluded that the high <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> emissions in this sector were due to high water temperature (26 to 31<span class="math inline">\(^{\circ}\)</span>C), high POC content in TSS originating from upstream urban ar, and organic matter degradation in the mangrove.</p>
<p>The variation of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> was also linked to independent effects of TRIX (12%) and TOC (10%) in the dry season (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-RDA-HP">3.16</a>a). Although a negative relationship between Chl-a and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> was considered as uptake of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span>), in the Saigon River, the trophic index (TRIX) or Chl-a was positively correlated with <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> in both seasons. This result was similar to another recent study in a subtropical lake in China <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Sun2021">Sun et al. 2021</a>)</span>. These results suggested that a large amount of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> concentrations was due to abundant organic carbon or to the contribution of lateral inputs, overwhelming the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> consumption by phytoplankton through photosynthesis. In rainy season, TSS, salinity, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> also accounted for 16%, 14%, 12% of independent effects on <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> variation, respectively (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-RDA-HP">3.16</a>b). Although HP analysis determined that alkalinity and salinity in the dry season accounted for 15% of independent effects on <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span>), the significant model selection by RDA indicated that they were non-significant explanatory variables in dry season. The POC content in TSS also shown a proportion many times higher in the upstream and urban area than in the downstream ones (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-gas-profile">3.11</a>), which supported the high <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> concentrations in these two areas, with a gradual decrease towards the sea. However, the results of RDA, HP analysis, and the monitoring dataset still do not fully explain the high <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> concentration in the upstream less polluted area. The upstream area of Saigon River may be affected by <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> from allochthonous inputs. e.g., <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span>)-rich sources in groundwater <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Marescaux2018">Marescaux, Thieu, and Garnier 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Overall, the positive correlation between <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> and the eutrophic status in the Saigon River indicated that respiration was significantly higher than photosynthesis, resulting in high <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> emissions. The <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> concentrations seemed to decrease only under the influence of dilution with coastal water along the estuarine gradient.</p>

<p>in the Saigon River, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> concentrations were much higher in urban than non-urban areas, as <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span>. Besides, an interesting finding was the significantly higher <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> concentrations in rainy than in dry season (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-gas-profile">3.11</a>). Figures 2 and 3 indicate that the water quality and eutrophication were worst in the extended urban area. The POC, TOC, and Chl-a had higher concentrations in these areas, which explained the higher concentration of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span>. Among the ten environmental variables explored, the contribution of Chl-a, TOC, DO and TRIX to <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> variation in dry season was 23%, 16%, 15%, 14%, respectively, while TSS and nutrients (N, P) accounted for less than 3% (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-season">3.8</a>a). <span class="citation">DelSontro, Beaulieu, and Downing (<a href="references.html#ref-DelSontro2019">2019</a>)</span> indicated that the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> emissions exponentially rose with the Chl-a concentration.

<p>The <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> concentration in the urban section of Saigon River in the rainy season was much higher than in the dry season (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-gas-profile">3.11</a>). <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NH_4^{+}}\)</span> and alkalinity accounted for the largest independent effects on 48% and 17% of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> variation (Figure <a href="cites-and-refs.html#fig:C3-RDA-HP">3.16</a>b). <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> formation occurs mainly in anoxic/anaerobic conditions, when most oxidants (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{O_{2}}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_{3}^{-}}\)</span>, Mn, <span class="math inline">\(SO_4^{2-}\)</span>) are completely depleted (Likens 2010). The <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{NO_{3}^{-}}\)</span> concentration remained in the range of 0.3 - 0.6 mgN<span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> in the Saigon River in both seasons. Therefore, the emission of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> in the water column was probably negligible in comparison to <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> production in sediment. Although Saigon River had high TOC concentration of about 6 mgC<span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span> and low DO (about 1 mgO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span><span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>) during the dry season, the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> concentration remained about 70 times lower than in the rainy season in the urban section. The lower <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> in the dry season might be due to methanotrophy, which consumed <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span>. During dry season, there was an increase in salinity in the urban area, leading to the generation of more electron acceptors and a consecutive decrease in methanogenesis. Lower <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> concentrations in the dry period could also be attributed to high respiration rates at the roots of the floating aquatic plants (supported by <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span>-oxidising bacteria) such as water hyacinths <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Attermeyer2016">Attermeyer et al. 2016</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-Nijman2021">Nijman et al. 2021</a>)</span>, while in the rainy season with stronger flushing capacity, macrophytes in the Saigon River were not as dense. The lower <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> concentrations in the surface water covered here by water hyacinths in dry season were comparable to the open water areas in a tropical lake in India <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Attermeyer2016">Attermeyer et al. 2016</a>)</span>. This study indicated that the coverage of water hyacinths only affected the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> concentration but did not strongly alter the <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> concentrations. Besides, <span class="citation">Rosentreter et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-Rosentreter2018">2018</a>)</span> suggested that the distinct <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> difference between the two seasons in tropical estuaries was contributed by flushing capacity. Stronger flushing capacity can promote remobilization of bottom organic matter as well as sediment-water process, which increases <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> concentration. Indeed, the average discharge in rainy season is ten times higher than in the dry season in the Saigon River <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-Nguyen2019">T. T. N.

</h2>
<p>This research provides comprehensive information about the impact of the urban discharge on eutrophication and GHGs emissions of an urbanized tropical estuary, the Saigon River Estuary. Average concentrations of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> were higher than the global GHGs concentration from about 10 to 300 times. Based on global warming potential, the total GHGs concentration in the Saigon River was nearly 15,000 <span class="math inline">\(\mu g\)</span><span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span>-eq<span class="math inline">\(L^{-1}\)</span>, in which <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> contributes to 70-90% of total GHGs. While <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span> concentration did not differ between the two seasons, the concentration of <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CH_4}\)</span> significantly differed between the dry and the rainy seasons. Based on the statistical analysis, the concentrations of three GHGs were linearly correlated with the eutrophication status of the estuary, especially in the dry season when phytoplankton was abundant. The analysis of AOU and <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{CO_2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{N_2O}\)</span> excess allows identifying an important contribution of oxic respiration and nitrification and denitrification in the formation of these GHGs. GHGs fluxes in the Saigon River were comparable to other urbanized estuaries worldwide regardless of climatic conditions. This study suggests that effective control of urban wastewater will minimize eutrophication, which is also an effective solution to reduce the greenhouse effect from estuaries.</p>
