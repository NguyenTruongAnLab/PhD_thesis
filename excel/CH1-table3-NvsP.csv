Process,N,P
Fixation,N can be fixed from N2 gas by some bacteria. N is not as often limiting phytoplankton growth in estuaries.,"P is not gaseous. There is a very small proportion of phosphine (PH3, a volatile P compound). Therefore, P has no atmospheric deposition contribution. "
Oxygen consumption,N metabolisms normally use oxygen such as nitrification,P metabolisms do not use oxygen.
Denitrification,"N can be removed from aquatic systems by denitrification, which converts NO3- to N2O and N2.","No P exists in the gaseous form, so there is no real process of P removal from water"
Settling and burial,"N can adsorb to suspended sediments, but this process is not strong. Absorbed N easily returns to the water column before the suspended sediment settles to the bottom.",P has a strong ability to adsorb to suspended sediment and settle to the riverbed. This process (burial) can remove P from the water column.
Toxicity,NH3 with high concentration can be toxic for fishes,P is nontoxic in an aquatic system
