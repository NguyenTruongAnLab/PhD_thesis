 pages = {845--858},
 volume = {624},
 journal = {The Science of the total environment},
 abstract = {Agriculture and urbanization have disturbed three-quarters of global ice-free land surface, delivering huge amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus to freshwater ecosystems. These excess nutrients degrade habitat and threaten human food and water security at a global scale. Because most catchments are either currently subjected to, or recovering from anthropogenic nutrient loading, understanding the short- and long-term responses of river nutrients to changes in land use is essential for effective management. We analyzed a never-published, 18-year time series of anthropogenic (NO3- and PO43-) and naturally derived (dissolved silica) riverine nutrients in 13 catchments recovering from agricultural pollution in western France. In a citizen science initiative, high-school students sampled catchments weekly, which ranged from 26 to 1489km2. Nutrient concentrations decreased substantially over the period of record (19 to 50{\%} for NO3- and 14 to 80{\%} for PO43-), attributable to regional, national, and international investment and regulation, which started immediately prior to monitoring. For the majority of catchments, water quality during the summer low-flow period improved faster than during winter high-flow conditions, and annual minimum concentrations improved relatively faster than annual maximum concentrations. These patterns suggest that water-quality improvements were primarily due to elimination of discrete nutrient sources with seasonally-constant discharge (e.g. human and livestock wastewater), agreeing with available land-use and municipal records. Surprisingly, long-term nutrient decreases were not accompanied by changes in nutrient seasonality in most catchments, attributable to persistent, diffuse nutrient stocks. Despite decreases, nutrient concentrations in almost all catchments remained well above eutrophication thresholds, and because additional improvements will depend on decreasing diffuse nutrient sources, future gains may be much slower than initial rate of recovery. These findings demonstrate the value of citizen science initiatives in quantifying long-term and seasonal consequences of changes in land management, which are necessary to identify sustainable limits and predict recovery timeframes.}

This leads to increasing nitrogen input to the water body and subsequently to eutrophication problems. The ammonium ion is a major component of nitrogen loading to coastal areas and since nitrogen is the limiting nutrient in many coastal marine waters, sediments are a major site controlling the cycling and availability of nitrogen. Ammonium can diffuse to overlying water and be adsorbed onto the sediment. The purpose of this experimental study was to find the adsorption coefficient and the adsorption isotherm of the ammonium ion for clay (Kaolinite and Montmorillonite) and sand (coarse and fine grades) using distilled and artificial sea water. This study showed that the ammonium adsorption for all four sediment types investigated was almost linear and fitted to the Freundlich isotherm within different concentrations in both distilled and artificial sea water. The adsorption in Montmorillonite, Kaolinite and coarse and fine sand in distilled water was higher than the amount of ammonium ions adsorbed in artificial sea water. The adsorption coefficient was higher under distilled water and lower under artificial sea water.}

 abstract = {Denitrification activity was measured by the acetylene blockage technique in six reservoirs of the Tiet{\^e} River, southeastern Brazil, in March 1999 and July 1999. The total number of bacteria was measured by DAPI while bacterial community structures were estimated with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using oligonucleotide probes specific to ribosomal RNA of the domain Bacteria; the alpha, beta and gamma subclasses of the Class Proteobacteria; the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium group; the Order Planktomycetales; and the Domain Archaea. Denitrification was detected only where anoxia or low concentrations of dissolved oxygen were observed. Maximum in situ denitrification integrated in the water column ranged from 1.36 to 3.79 mmol-N2O m-2 day-1 in the rainy season and in the dry season, respectively, both at Station 1, the upstream portion of Barra Bonita Reservoir influenced by the sewage carried out by the river from S{\~a}o Paulo City. Bacterioplankton community analysis by FISH showed that the Alpha subclass of the class Proteobacteria was the main subgroup in the middle and low Tiet{\^e} River (Fig. 3), represented by 10.3-19.2{\%} of total, followed by the Beta Subclass of Proteobacteria and the Cytophaga/ Flavobacterium group, represented by 8.3-13.3{\%} and 3.4-10.9{\%}, respectively). This result differs from the proportion of bacterial subgroups in water bodies of temperate regions, suggesting that bacterial communities of water bodies of the tropical region may differ from those of temperate regions.}

 journal = {The Science of the total environment},
 abstract = {Groundwater discharge is known to transport nutrients into estuaries at several locations around the world. However, few studies report groundwater-associated nutrient fluxes from tropical developing regions such as Southeast Asia, even though this area shows the strongest human modifications in the coastal zone worldwide. We investigated groundwater nutrient flux into two streams and estuaries (Awur and Sekumbu Bay) in the urban area of Jepara, Indonesia, and its relation with the land usage surrounding the estuaries. We found that average concentrations of NO3, NH4, and PO4 in Jepara's aquifer reached 145\textgreek{m}M, 68\textgreek{m}M, and 14\textgreek{m}M, respectively, and our results indicate that these were mainly originated from untreated sewage, agriculture, and manure input. Approximately 2200tonNyear-1 and 380tonPyear-1 were removed in the soil and aquifer before the nutrients were discharged into the river. The total groundwater discharge into the river and estuary was estimated to 461$\times$103m3d-1, or up to 42{\%} of the river discharge. Discharge of groundwater-associated NO3 (72$\times$103mold-1), NH4 (34$\times$103mold-1), PO4 (5$\times$103mold-1), and additional surface runoff may contribute to eutrophication and a decrease of nearshore surface water quality. Nutrient concentrations in groundwater, river, and coastal seawater in the Jepara region are similar to those found in major urban areas in Southeast Asia, e.g. Manila and Bangkok, even though Jepara has smaller size and population. Thus, our results indicate that medium populated cities with highly modified regional land use can contribute a significant amount of nutrient discharge in the coastal area and should be included in global assessments of nutrient budget calculation.}

 abstract = {The lower Seine River is severely affected by the release of the treated wastewater from the 12 million inhabitants of the Paris agglomeration. Whereas urban effluents were the major source of phosphorus pollution in the late 1980s, the ban on polyphosphates from detergents in 1991 considerably reduced the phosphorus (P) loading to the Seine River and was followed in 2000 by the implementation of phosphorus treatment in the largest wastewater treatment plant of Paris conurbation (Seine Aval). Phosphorus discharged to the rivers from domestic wastewater was reduced by 80~{\%}, significantly decreasing phytoplankton biomass in the large branches of the Seine River. Considering that phosphorus treatment (the use of ferric salts in the P treatment line) might change the adsorption of ortho-phosphates on suspended matter, we experimentally studied again their sorption processes in these new conditions. We found parameters of the Langmuir equation (Pac~=~0.003~mgP~mgSS$-$1; Kps~=~0.04~mgP~L$-$1) that significantly differed from the values previously considered for modeling of the whole Seine, especially for Kps (Pac~=~0.0055~mgP~mgSS$-$1; Kps~=~0.7~mgP~L$-$1). Using the Seneque-Rivertrahler modeling approach, we showed a better agreement between P observations and simulations with the new P sorption parameters, with slight effect on the simulation of the development of phytoplankton in the water column.},

 abstract = {Nitrite is a toxic intermediate compound in the nitrogen (N) cycle. Elevated concentrations of nitrite have been observed in the Seine River, raising questions about its sources and fate. Here, we assess the role of bottom sediments as potential sources or sinks of nitrite along the river continuum. Sediment cores were collected from two depocenters, one located upstream, the other downstream, from the largest wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) servicing the conurbation of Paris. Pore water profiles of oxygen, nitrate, nitrite and ammonium were measured. Ammonium, nitrate and nitrite fluxes across the sediment-water interface (SWI) were determined in separate core incubation experiments. The data were interpreted with a one-dimensional, multi-component reactive transport model, which accounts for the production and consumption of nitrite through nitrification, denitrification, anammox and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). In all core incubation experiments, nitrate uptake by the sediments was observed, indicative of high rates of denitrification. In contrast, for both sampling locations, the sediments in cores collected in August 2012 acted as sinks for nitrite, but those collected in October 2013 released nitrite to the overlying water. The model results suggest that the first step of nitrification generated most pore water nitrite at the two locations. While nitrification was also the main pathway consuming nitrite in the sediments upstream of the WWTP, anammox dominated nitrite removal at the downstream site. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the magnitude and direction of the benthic nitrite fluxes most strongly depend on bottom water oxygenation and the deposition flux of labile organic matter.}

C/N variation in the sediment surface POM is a function of initial suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) (or other POM) type and the alteration of C/N ratios in the water column or on the sediment surface. The $δ$13C(SPOM) (- 20 to - 25‰) values suggest that this material is a mixture of: (1) in situ phytoplankton organic matter; (2) terrestrial river-borne SPOM; (3) terrestrial river-borne bottom sediment POM; and (4) sewage. Downcore variation in organic carbon content, C/N and $δ$13C is attributed mainly to change in the supply rate and type of organic matter. In the NE of Hunts Bay, down core variation in sedimentology and geochemistry are consistent with a change from fully marne to freshwater runoff-dominated sedimentation with increasing organic matter input from sewage in recent times. Despite large overlaps in the C/N and $δ$13C(org) 'end-members' pollutant POM, in this case sewage, was the only source which could account for the amount of POM deposited, the surface sediment C/N and $δ$13C(org) values and the trajectories of evolution in C/N and $δ$13C(org) values in cores. The data show that the combined $δ$13C and C/N successfully identifies the source, fate and history of POM even in a poorly-mixed estuary.}

 abstract = {A fully transient, two-dimensional nested grid reactive-transport model of the Scheldt tidal river-estuary continuum is used to quantify seasonally-resolved silica and nitrogen filtering capacities and export fluxes to the coastal zone over a period of one year. Simulation results indicate that a pronounced seasonal variability in nutrient cycling results from the combined effect of biogeochemical transformations and nutrient flux imbalances, which arise from the time-lagged response of the scalar fields to hydrological perturbations. Dissolved silica reveals a larger mass storage capacity and a slower flux response to upstream perturbations than nitrogen. As a consequence, the nutrient export flux ratio to the coastal zone, which is instrumental for the marine phytoplankton dynamics, depends strongly on the transient propagation of the scalar fluxes. The estuarine nutrient retention shows a strong temporal variability, which is driven by the complex interplay between reaction and transport. Results reveal that seasonal filtering capacities, with values comprised between 0.01 and 0.81 for silica and 0.13 and 0.78 for nitrogen, cannot be estimated by existing empirical relationships between this parameter and freshwater residence time. At the seasonal scale, nutrient export fluxes to the coastal zone cannot be quantified from the river loads and the estuarine filtering capacities. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {This study presents a first attempt to quantify the biogeochemical transformations and fluxes of carbon and nutrients along the entire mixing zone of the shallow, tidally-dominated estuary-coastal zone continuum of the Scheldt (Belgium/The Netherlands). A fully transient, two-dimensional, nested-grid hydrodynamic model of the continuum is coupled to the biogeochemical MIRO model for the coastal zone and the CONTRASTE model for the estuary. Transient model simulations are performed with a high spatial (80-750 m) and temporal (30 min) resolution over a period of one year (January-December 1995). The high temporal resolution allows including the short-term variability triggered by the tides, the freshwater discharge and the wind stress. System scale simulations provide time series of nutrient transformations and fluxes along the entire estuary-coastal zone continuum, as well as highly resolved nutrient inventories for the estuarine and the coastal zone sub-domains. Simulation results reveal that the balance between highly variable estuarine nutrient inputs and physical constrains set by the unsteady residual transport field exert an important control on the magnitude and succession of phytoplankton blooms and the ecosystem structure in the coastal zone. In addition, they suggest that the poorly surveyed estuarine-coastal zone interface plays a central role in the continuum. In this dynamic area, marked spatial concentration gradients develop and episodically lead to a reversal of material fluxes from the coast into the estuary. During distinct episodes of the productive period, euryhaline coastal diatoms intrude far upstream into the saline estuary. This intrusion reduces the estuarine nutrient concentrations and export fluxes, thereby reinforcing the nutrient limitation in the coastal area. As a consequence, the estuarine filter does not operate independently from the processes in the coastal zone. The dynamic interplay between the two ecosystems and the intense process rates operating at their transition, therefore, strongly supports our continuum approach. {\copyright}2010 Elsevier B.V.},

However, these systems are underrepresented in global datasets of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study investigated the carbon (C) turnover and GHG emissions from a small (0.6 km(2)) water-harvesting lake in South India and analysed the effect of floating macrophytes on these emissions. We measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions with gas chambers in the field as well as water C mineralization rates and physicochemical variables in both the open water and in water within stands of water hyacinths. The CO2 and CH4 emissions from areas covered by water hyacinths were reduced by 57{\%} compared with that of open water. However, the C mineralization rates were not significantly different in the water between the two areas. We conclude that the increased invasion of water hyacinths and other floating macrophytes has the potential to change GHG emissions, a process that might be relevant in regional C budgets.}

In this framework, hydrodynamic and salinity transport modelling of the Saigon River is performed using the MIKE 11 modelling system. In the first optimisation step this simulation model is coupled with the population simplex evolution (PSE) algorithm from the AUTOCAL optimisation utility (available as a part of MIKE 11) to estimate the discharge required to meet salinity standards at the downstream location of Hoa Phu pumping station for public water supply. In the second optimisation step, with the use of MATLAB optimisation toolbox, an elitist multi-objective genetic algorithm is coupled with a simple water balance model of the Dautieng reservoir to investigate how the optimised discharges obtained from the first optimisation step can be balanced with the other objectives of the reservoir. The results indicate that optimised releases improve the performance of the reservoir especially on controlling salinity at Hoa Phu pumping station. In addition, the study demonstrates that use of smaller time steps in optimisation gives a closer match between varying demands and releases.},

 abstract = {We evaluated changes in the phytoplankton community in Korean coastal waters during October 2016 and February 2017. Typhoon Chaba introduced a large amount of freshwater into the coastal areas during autumn 2016, and there was a significant negative relationship between salinity and nutrients in the Nakdong estuarine area, particularly in the northeastern area (Zone III; p {\textless} 0.001). The abundance of diatom species, mainly Chaetoceros spp., increased after this nutrient loading, whereas Cryptomonas spp. appeared as opportunists when there was relatively low diatom biomass. During winter, biotic and abiotic factors did not differ among the surface, middle, and lower layers (p {\textgreater} 0.01; ANOVA), implying that water mixing by winter windstorms and low surface temperature (due to the sinking of high-density water) physically accelerated mixing of the whole water column. Diatoms predominated under these conditions. Among diatoms, the centric diatom Eucampia zodiacus remained at high density at the inshore area and its abundance had a negative correlation with water temperature, implying that this species can grow at cold temperatures. On the other hand, the harmful freshwater diatom Stephanodiscus hantzschii mainly appeared in conditions with low salinity and high nutrients, implying that it can persist even in the saltwater conditions of the Nakdong Estuary. Our results indicate that hydro-oceanographic characteristics, such as river discharge after an autumn typhoon and winter water turbulence, have major effects on the composition of phytoplankton communities and can potentially affect the occurrence and characteristics of harmful algal blooms in southern Korean coastal waters.}

 abstract = {The spatio-temporal variations of the \textgreek{d}13C and \textgreek{d}15N of suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM), along with ancillary chemical and hydrographic parameters, have been examined monthly for one year (October 2010 to September 2011) at a total of seven stations to refine the understanding of SPOM sources and biogeochemical pathways in the tropical Zuari Estuary, west coast of India. The dynamic nature of C and N cycling in estuaries is reflected in the isotopic variation of SPOM as a function of space and time. The results exhibit marked seasonality, with the autochthonous component and the terrestrial component being the major SPOM sources during periods of low and high river discharges, respectively. Spatially, enrichments of \textgreek{d}13C and \textgreek{d}15N from the head (\textgreek{d}13C=-29.6‰, \textgreek{d}15N=1.78‰, C/N=7.09) to the mouth (\textgreek{d}13C=-20.9‰, \textgreek{d}15N=5.77‰, C/N=6.12) of the estuary indicate downstream reduction of terrigenous influence. The mean C:N ratios varied between 4 and 9 over the study period with low values during the monsoon, in spite of large terrestrial input, which can be attributed to microbial modification of terrestrial SPOM. A significant positive correlation of \textgreek{d}13C with salinity suggests the reliability of \textgreek{d}13C as a biogeochemical tracer for organic matter provenance. Carbon:chlorophyll plots reveal suppressed autochthonous production during the southwest monsoon which may be attributed to the rapid flushing time, light-limitation due to cloud cover and high water-column turbidity.},

 pages = {116985},
 volume = {196},
 journal = {Water Research},
 abstract = {Lakes are important sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere. Factors controlling CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes include eutrophication and warming, but the integrated influence of climate-warming-driven stratification, oxygen loss and resultant changes in bloom characteristics on GHGs are not well understood. Here we assessed the influence of contrasting meteorological conditions on stratification and phytoplankton bloom composition in a eutrophic lake, and tested for associated changes in GHGs inventories in both the shallow and deep waters, over three seasons (2010-2012). Atmospheric heatwaves had one of the most dramatic effects on GHGs. Indeed, cyanobacterial blooms that developed in response to heatwave events in 2012 enhanced both sedimentary CH4 concentrations (reaching up to 1mM) and emissions to the atmosphere (up to 8 mmol m-2 d-1). That summer, CH4 contributed 52{\%} of the integrated warming potential of GHGs produced in the lake (in CO2 equivalents) as compared to between 34 and 39{\%} in years without cyanobacterial blooms. High CH4 accumulation and subsequent emission in 2012 were preceded by CO2 and N2O consumption and under-saturation at the lake surface (uptakes at -30 mmol m-2 d-1 and -1.6 µmol m-2 d-1, respectively). Fall overturn presented a large efflux of N2O and CH4, particularly from the littoral zone after the cyanobacterial bloom. We provide evidence that, despite cooling observed at depth during hot summers, CH4 emissions increased via stronger stratification and surface warming, resulting in enhanced cyanobacterial biomass deposition and intensified bottom water anoxia. Our results, supported by recent literature reports, suggests a novel interplay between climate change effects on lake hydrodynamics that impacts both bloom characteristics and GHGs production in shallow eutrophic lakes. Given global trends of warming and enrichment, these interactive effects should be considered to more accurately predict the future global role of lakes in GHG emissions.}

 abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N(2)O) is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change and stratospheric ozone destruction. Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) loading to river networks is a potentially important source of N(2)O via microbial denitrification that converts N to N(2)O and dinitrogen (N(2)). The fraction of denitrified N that escapes as N(2)O rather than N(2) (i.e., the N(2)O yield) is an important determinant of how much N(2)O is produced by river networks, but little is known about the N(2)O yield in flowing waters. Here, we present the results of whole-stream (15)N-tracer additions conducted in 72 headwater streams draining multiple land-use types across the United States. We found that stream denitrification produces N(2)O at rates that increase with stream water nitrate (NO(3)(-)) concentrations, but that {\textless}1{\%} of denitrified N is converted to N(2)O. Unlike some previous studies, we found no relationship between the N(2)O yield and stream water NO(3)(-). We suggest that increased stream NO(3)(-) loading stimulates denitrification and concomitant N(2)O production, but does not increase the N(2)O yield. In our study, most streams were sources of N(2)O to the atmosphere and the highest emission rates were observed in streams draining urban basins. Using a global river network model, we estimate that microbial N transformations (e.g., denitrification and nitrification) convert at least 0.68 Tg·y(-1) of anthropogenic N inputs to N(2)O in river networks, equivalent to 10{\%} of the global anthropogenic N(2)O emission rate. This estimate of stream and river N(2)O emissions is three times greater than estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.}

 abstract = {Lakes and impoundments are an important source of methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas, to the atmosphere. A recent analysis shows aquatic productivity (i.e., eutrophication) is an important driver of CH4 emissions from lentic waters. Considering that aquatic productivity will increase over the next century due to climate change and a growing human population, a concomitant increase in aquatic CH4 emissions may occur. We simulate the eutrophication of lentic waters under scenarios of future nutrient loading to inland waters and show that enhanced eutrophication of lakes and impoundments will substantially increase CH4 emissions from these systems (+30-90{\%}) over the next century. This increased CH4 emission has an atmospheric impact of 1.7-2.6 Pg C-CO2-eq y-1, which is equivalent to 18-33{\%} of annual CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels. Thus, it is not only important to limit eutrophication to preserve fragile water supplies, but also to avoid acceleration of climate change.}

The tidal exchange of DSi, and hence estuarine water, with the coastal water body was high, with around 82{\%} of the incoming flood tide comprising ``new'' ocean water. This exchange process was strongly influenced by the quasi-periodic non-tidal alongshore current, but only weakly by variation in river discharge and tidal range. It appears that complete mixing of fresh water (under normal flow conditions) and riverine solutes occurs over a relatively narrow coastal zone (2--3 km) along this stretch of the Coromandel Peninsula. {\copyright} The Royal Society of New Zealand 1994.}

In this study, we investigated the relationships between eutrophication and GHG emissions in a highly urbanized tropical reservoir in S{\~a}o Paulo Metropolitan Area (Brazil). CO2 and CH4 fluxes and limnological variables (water and sediment) were collected at three sampling stations classified as hypereutrophic and eutrophic. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the principal component analysis (PCA) determined the most significant parameters to CO2 and CH4 fluxes. ANOVA showed significant differences of CO2 and CH4 fluxes between sampling stations with different trophic state. The hypereutrophic station showed higher mean fluxes for both CO2 and CH4 (5.43 $\pm$ 1.04 and 0.325 $\pm$ 0.167 g m-2 d-1, respectively) than the eutrophic stations (3.36 $\pm$ 0.54 and 0.060 $\pm$ 0.005 g m-2 d-1). The PCA showed a strong relationship between nutrients in the water column (surface and bottom) and GHG fluxes. We concluded that GHG fluxes were higher whenever the trophic state increases as observed previously in temperate and tropical reservoirs. High concentrations of nutrients in the water column in the studied area support the high production of autotrophic biomass that, when sedimented, ends up serving as organic matter for CH4 producers. These outcomes reinforce the necessity of water quality improvement and eutrophication mitigation in highly urbanized reservoirs in tropical regions.}

 abstract = {A model of three functional groups of macroalgae, drift algae, rhizophytic calcareous algae, and seagrass epiphytes, was developed to complement an existing seagrass production model for tropical habitats dominated by Thalassia testudinum (Turtle-grass). The current modeling effort simulates annual biomass dynamics for each of the three functional groups under a variety of stress regimes imposed by nutrient-laden freshwater discharges into a well-flushed coastal bay in South Florida. The model is parameterized based on multiple years of experimental data collected from Biscayne Bay, as well as literature values reported for other Florida and Caribbean seagrass habitats. Calibration of the model yields a good fit of predicted-to-observed biomass (r2{\textgreater}0.85) for sheet-flow and oceanic-influenced sites, but a poor fit (r 2=0.13) under canal-influenced conditions. This is hypothesized to be related to the lack of adequate observed data on seagrass epiphyte dynamics to parameterize the model. Sensitivity analysis showed that the model is easily perturbed by changes in intrinsic growth parameters of the algae (daily growth rate, mortality rate, carrying capacity), while it is much less sensitive to changes in the functional form of the response curves that are used to characterize the stress tolerances of the algae to light, temperature, salinity, and nutrient conditions. This model is considered suitable for use in seagrass habitats similar to those occurring in South Florida, as these are the conditions to which the model was calibrated. {\copyright}2003 Elsevier B.V.

The RIVERSTRAHLER Model, based on the concept of stream-order, has been established for that purpose. It has been applied here on two rivers from the Seine basin: rivers Marne and Oise. It is shown that hydrological factors determine the time of onset, and the position within the drainage network, of the spring algal bloom. Phosphorus availability, when limiting, controls the intensity of the bloom.

 journal = {Aquatic Microbial Ecology},
 abstract = {Human impact on the coastal zone is mainly exerted through riverine nutrient delivery, dependent on land use and management of the watershed. The link between human activity and coastal eutrophication is not direct, however, because of the complexity of the processes involved in the retention or elimination of nutrients during their transfer along the aquatic continuum from land to sea. In order to explore this link, we make use of 2 idealized models respectively representing the ecological functioning of whole drainage networks including their stagnants annexes (the Riverstrahler model) and of river impacted coastal systems (the Zoco model). Coupling of these 2 models, which use exactly the same kinetic formulation for all microbiological processes with only slightly different parameter values, allows simulation of the major trends of the seasonal variations of coastal algal blooms in response to changes in land use in the watershed. The models were applied to a hypothetical river-coastal zone system (the 'Phison River' and its plume in 'Eden Bight'), for a chronological succession of land use and management scenarios, ranging from the pristine forested watershed to the dense urbanization conditions of Western European industrialized countries. The results show that, as early as the beginning of the 19th century, development of intense blooms of non-diatoms, accompanied by a shift from phosphorus limitation to silica/nitrogen limitation, might have occurred in the coastal zone. In the second half of the 20th century, increased use of nitrogen fertilizers, coming after the suppression of wetlands and buffer strips along rivers, might have again pushed the coastal system to phosphorus limitation, while the introduction of phosphorus-containing washing powders (from the mid 1960s) again reversed this trend. Under the chosen conditions of land use and population density, it was found that elimination of nitrogen from wastewater through generalized tertiary treatment would not produce very significant changes in the eutrophication status of the coastal zone. On the other hand, phosphorus removal from point sources, preferably combined with wetlands restoration, would lead to a drastic reduction of algal blooms with a new shift to phosphorus limitation.}

 abstract = {A new version of the 'Riverstrahler' model has been developed for modelling riverine transfers of nitrogen from diffuse sources within the watershed, using land use data as a forcing function, together with an adjustable riparian transfer coefficient. Application of the model to the Seine river system (divided into four main sub-basins and one main branch) allows to establish a comprehensive budget of nitrogen transfers through the whole drainage network and to quantify the overall retention by riparian wetlands. According to the sub-basins, the figures indicate that 25-55{\%} of the nitrogen coming from below the root-zone of agricultural land or from the aquifers is retained or eliminated before reaching surface water. The lower retention is found in areas where dense agricultural draining has been installed, thus by-passing riparian wetlands. At the scale of the Seine catchment, riparian retention represents 70 - 110 103 tonN y-1, while in-stream retention accounts for only 24-32 103 tonN y-1. The data suggest that landscape management, like restoration of efficient riparian systems in areas where they have been suppressed or by-passed, might be an efficient alternative or complimentary strategy for reducing nitrate contamination of surface water, with respect to tertiary treatment of point wastewater discharges.}

 abstract = {A model (the Riverstrahler model) is used to describe nutrient transfer and transformation at the scale of the whole drainage network of the Seine based on information concerning the basic mechanisms governing N, P and Si inputs to the drainage network and in-stream transformation and retention. It was used to calculate the budget of these nutrients through the whole river continuum from land to sea. With the help of historical documents, the constraints used as forcing function in this model were reconstructed to express the changing conditions of land-use and urban population over the last five hundred years. The corresponding scenarios were run for different hydrological regimes including dry, mean and wet conditions. The results were validated on the long-term series of nutrient measurements spanning more than a century available at some stations on the Seine, upstream and downstream of the city of Paris. The model was also used to explore past and future trends in nutrient loading, retention and delivery to the coastal zone, in response to human management of the terrestrial watershed. Beside the initial pristine state, used as an idealized reference state (with N, P and Si delivered fluxes of about 45-110~kg N km- 2 yr- 1, 2-5~kg P km- 2 yr- 1, 510-1325~kg Si km- 2 yr- 1), four periods were distinguished. The first one is that of the traditional cottage economy which prevailed, with quite a constant total population, until the end of the 18th century. N, P and Si fluxes were about 235-750~kg N km- 2 yr- 1, 15-60~kg P km- 2 yr- 1 and 425-1280~kg Si km- 2 yr- 1, depending on hydrological conditions. The second period, from the beginning of the 19th century to about the 1950$\prime$s, corresponded to rapid increase in the total and urban population with a corresponding increase of point sources of N and P. From 1950 onwards, modern farming practices resulted in a dramatic increase in diffuse sources of nitrogen and to a lesser extent phosphorus: riverine N and P export reached 1320-2800~kg N km- 2 yr- 1, and 310-340~kg P km- 2 yr- 1: silica export remained fairly constant at around 410-1260~kg Si km- 2 yr- 1 depending on the hydrological conditions. In the 1990$\prime$s, the fourth period is represented by a stabilized population and improved wastewater treatment, when the export of phosphorus is reduced to values as low as 40-60~kg P km- 2 yr- 1, but without as effective a reduction of nitrogen export. This represents an unprecedented situation for the marine coastal system, i.e. a shift from nitrogen to phosphorus limitation, as nitrogen is still delivered far in excess of the amount of silica available for diatom blooms. {\copyright}2006 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {The amount of nutrients (N, P, Si) carried to the coastal zone by large river systems, as well as the balance between these elements, are the major determinants of coastal marine eutrophication problems. Many of these problems are the consequence of the new production of non-siliceous algae, sustained by nitrogen and phosphorus delivered by rivers in excess over dissolved silica, in regard to the requirements for diatom growth. Besides their N:P:Si ratios, an indicator of coastal eutrophication potential (ICEP) of riverine nutrient inputs is proposed. It represents the carbon biomass potentially produced in the receiving coastal water body through new production sustained by the flux of nitrogen or phosphorus (according to which one is limiting with respect to the other) delivered in excess over silica. For the purpose of a river to river comparison, it is expressed by unit of watershed area, in kg C km- 2 day- 1. This indicator reaches high, positive values in many temperate European and North American river systems known to cause severe eutrophication problems in their receiving coastal zones, while it remains at negative values for pristine Nordic rivers as well as for most (sub-)tropical river systems. The analysis of reconstructed past scenarios of the biogeochemical functioning of the Seine and Scheldt river systems, as well as a number of retrospective studies carried out for other river systems under temperate conditions and strong human influence, shows that both nitrogen and phosphorus were delivered to the coastal zone in excess over silica as soon as the beginning of the 19th century. The period 1950-1990 was the worst in terms of unbalanced nutrient delivery to the coastal zone. Since the 1990's, phosphorus fluxes have decreased very rapidly, largely as a result of improved urban wastewater treatment and concomitant banishment of polyphosphates in the washing powders, while nitrogen delivery still remains at high levels as a consequence of intensive agricultural practices, creating an unprecedented biogeochemical situation in the coastal zone, with low phosphorus but high nitrogen contamination. {\copyright}2007 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {The set-up, application and validation of a generic ecological model (GEM) for estuaries and coastal waters is presented. This model is a comprehensive ecological model of the bottom of the foodweb, consisting of a set of modules, representing specific water quality processes and primary production that can be combined with any transport model to create a dedicated model for a specific ecosystem. GEM links different physical, chemical and ecological model components into one generic and flexible modelling tool that allows for variable sized, curvilinear grids to accomodate both the requirements for local accuracy while maintaining a relatively short model run-time. The GEM model describes the behaviour of nutrients, organic matter and primary producers in estuaries and coastal waters, incorporating dynamic process modules for dissolved oxygen, nutrients and phytoplankton. GEM integrates the best aspects of existing Dutch estuarine models that were mostly dedicated to only one type of ecosystem, geographic area or subset of processes. Particular strengths of GEM include its generic applicability and the integration and interaction of biological, chemical and physical processes into one predictive tool. The model offers flexibility in choosing which processes to include, and the ability to integrate results from different processes modelled simultaneously with different temporal resolutions. The generic applicability of the model is illustrated using a number of representative examples from case studies in which the GEM model was successfully applied. Validation of these examples was carried out using the 'cost function' to compare model results with field observations. The validation results demonstrated consistent accuracy of the GEM model for various key parameters in both spatial dimensions (horizontally and vertically) as well as temporal dimensions (seasonally and across years) for a variety of water systems without the need for major reparameterisation. {\copyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.}

Surface waters of the Meuse river network were over-saturated in CO2, CH4, N2O with respect to atmospheric equilibrium, acting as sources of these greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, although the dissolved gases also showed marked seasonal and spatial variations. Seasonal variations were related to changes in freshwater discharge following the hydrological cycle, with highest concentrations of CO2, CH4, N2O during low water owing to a longer water residence time and lower currents (i.e. lower gas transfer velocities), both contributing to the accumulation of gases in the water column, combined with higher temperatures favourable to microbial processes. Inter-annual differences of discharge also led to differences in CH4 and N2O that were higher in years with prolonged low water periods. Spatial variations were mostly due to differences in land cover over the catchments, with systems dominated by agriculture (croplands and pastures) having higher CO2, CH4, N2O levels than forested systems. This seemed to be related to higher levels of dissolved and particulate organic matter, as well as dissolved inorganic nitrogen in agriculture dominated systems compared to forested ones. Groundwater had very low CH4 concentrations in the shallow and unconfined aquifers (mostly fractured limestones) of the Meuse basin, hence, should not contribute significantly to the high CH4 levels in surface riverine waters. Owing to high dissolved concentrations, groundwater could potentially transfer important quantities of CO2 and N2O to surface waters of the Meuse basin, although this hypothesis remains to be tested.}

 abstract = {We monitored the stable nitrogen isotopic composition (\textgreek{d} 15N) of suspended matter and ammonium in the freshwater stretch of the Scheldt estuary (Belgium) over a full year to investigate for seasonal evolution and possible co-variation between isotopic signatures. The \textgreek{d}15N value of ammonium remained rather constant during winter (average = +11.4‰) but increased significantly with the spring and summer bloom, reaching values as high as +70‰. This enrichment of the ammonium pool in 15N coincided with significant ammonium depletion during summer period, suggesting a close causal relationship. Based on a semi-closed system approach we deduced an apparent fractionation factor associated with NH 4+ utilization (i.e. combining effects of uptake and nitrification) of 18.4‰ (SE = 2.0‰), which is similar to values reported in literature. Observed variations of ammonium \textgreek{d}15N could account for about 69{\%} of \textgreek{d}15N variation in suspended matter. {\copyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.}

 journal = {Front. Mar. Sci.},
 abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) is one of the most important greenhouse gases and a major sink for stratospheric ozone. Estuaries are sites of intense biological production and N2O emissions. We aimed to identify hot spots of N2O production and potential pathways contributing to N2O concentrations in the surface water of the tidal Elbe estuary. During two research cruises in April and June 2015, surface water N2O concentrations were measured along the salinity gradient of the Elbe estuary by using a laser-based on-line analyzer coupled to an equilibrator. Based on these high-resolution N2O profiles, N2O saturations, and fluxes across the surface water/atmosphere interface were calculated. Additional measurements of DIN concentrations, oxygen concentration, and salinity were performed. Highest N2O concentrations were determined in the Hamburg port region reaching maximum values of 32.3 nM in April 2015 and 52.2 nM in June 2015. These results identify the Hamburg port region as a significant hot spot of N2O production, where linear correlations of AOU-N2Oxs indicate nitrification as an important contributor to N2O production in the freshwater part. However, in the region with lowest oxygen saturation, sediment denitrification obviously affected water column N2O saturation. The average N2O saturation over the entire estuary was 201{\%} (SD: $\pm$94{\%}), with an average estuarine N2O flux density of 48 $μ$mol m-2 d-1 and an overall emission of 0.18 Gg N2O y-1. In comparison to previous studies, our data indicate that N2O production pathways over the whole estuarine freshwater part have changed from predominant denitrification in the 1980s toward significant production from nitrification in the present estuary. Despite a significant reduction in N2O saturation compared to the 1980s, N2O concentrations nowadays remain on a high level, comparable to the mid-90s, although a steady decrease of DIN inputs occurred over the last decades. Hence, the Elbe estuary still remains an important source of N2O to the atmosphere.}

 abstract = {Riverbank erosion near river mouth is an increasingly serious problem for social-economic activities and natural environment of Southeast Asia. There are many factors impact on erosion process such as bank materials, mangrove trees, aquatic animal burrows, meteorological and hydrodynamic conditions. In this paper, the authors investigated the critical shear stress for erosion of cohesive riverbanks in the Soai Rap River, southern Viet Nam. The results showed that the riverbanks have been moderately eroded with the critical shear stresses range from 0 to 5.731 N/M2 and the erodibility coefficients range from 0.497 to 9.07 cm3/N-s. Simultaneously, the authors applied numerical models to verify the distribution of shear velocities in the study area. In condition with tidal currents, the significant shear velocities mainly appear in the upper part of the Soai Rap River and in the Dong Tranh River (near river mouth). In condition with waves, the significant shear velocities only appear at the river mouth. In conditions with both tidal currents and waves, the significant shear velocities appear in upper part of the Soai Rap River and at the river mouth. The simulation results indicate that the distribution of shear velocities agree quite closely with the field survey data. {\copyright}2008 IEEE.}

 abstract = {Less than one year (2007/11 - 2008/08), Soai Rap riverbanks (southern Viet Nam) have been eroded severely. The erosion rates of some positions have been greater than 10 m/year. The wind waves and ship waves integrated with strong tidal currents have been considered as the dominant factors. The cohesive soil properties with dense dead mangrove roots and many holes of aquatic animals cause the banks to be weakened. The aim of this study is to investigate the erosion mechanisms of cohesive bed and bank materials based on in situ measurements, flume and wave basin experiments. The numerical models are also applied to calculate the distribution of shear velocities caused by waves and tidal currents. The results showed that erosion rates of cohesive bank materials are greater than those of cohesive bed materials from 2 to 10 times. The applied shear stresses are mainly distributed around river mouth and in the surfzone. These results indicate that local high waves approach to the banks are the main factor which causes bank erode severely. The mixing rates of sand, silt and clay contents, moisture contents are the factors effect on stability of the cohesive bed and bank strongly. Other factors such as dead roots and leaves, holes of aquatic animals and salinity can also cause bank and bed unstable.

 abstract = {Warming climate is predicted to promote cyanobacterial blooms but the toxicity of cyanobacteria under global warming is less well studied. We tested the hypothesis that raising temperature may lead to increased growth rates but to decreased microcystin (MC) production in tropical Microcystis strains. To this end, six Microcystis strains were isolated from different water bodies in Southern Vietnam. They were grown in triplicate at 27 °C (low), 31 °C (medium), 35 °C (high) and 37 °C (extreme). Chlorophyll-a-, particle- and MC concentrations as well as dry-weights were determined. All strains yielded higher biomass in terms of chlorophyll-a concentration and dry-weight at 31 °C compared to 27 °C and then either stabilised, slightly increased or declined with higher temperature. Five strains easily grew at 37 °C but one could not survive at 37 °C. When temperature was increased from 27 °C to 37 °C total MC concentration decreased by 35{\%} in strains with MC-LR as the dominant variant and by 94{\%} in strains with MC-RR. MC quota expressed per particle, per unit chlorophyll-a and per unit dry-weight significantly declined with higher temperatures. This study shows that warming can prompt the growth of some tropical Microcystis strains but that these strains become less toxic.},

 abstract = {Coastal areas are subject to a great anthropogenic pressure because more than half of the world's population lives in its vicinity causing organic matter inputs, which intensifies greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Dissolved concentrations of CH4 and N2O have been measured seasonally during 2013 in the Guadalete River Estuary, which flows into the Cadiz Bay (southwestern Spanish coast). It has been intensely contaminated since 1970. Currently it receives wastewater effluents from cities and direct discharges from nearby agriculture crop. Eight sampling stations have been established along 18km of the estuary. CH4 and N2O were measured using a gas chromatograph connected to an equilibration system. Additional parameters such as organic matter, dissolved oxygen, nutrients and chlorophyll were determinate as well, in order to understand the relationship between physicochemical and biological processes. Gas concentrations increased from the River mouth toward the inner part, closer to the wastewater treatment plant discharge. Values varied widely within 21.8 and 3483.4nM for CH4 and between 9.7 and 147.6nM for N2O. Greenhouse gas seasonal variations were large influenced by the precipitation regime, masking the temperature influence. The Guadatete Estuary acted as a greenhouse gas source along the year, with mean fluxes of 495.7$μ$molm-2d-1 and 92.8$μ$molm-2d-1 for CH4 and N2O, respectively.},

 journal = {The Science of the total environment},
 abstract = {There is still much uncertainty regarding the global oceanic emissions of N2O, and particularly emissions from coastal regions, because spatio-temporal datasets have limited coverage. The concentration of dissolved N2O in surface waters and the associated fluxes to the atmosphere have been studied in three coastal systems located near Cadiz Bay (southwestern coast of Spain) over different time scales. The three systems present different hydrodynamic characteristics (an estuary and two marine systems) that influence the distribution of N2O in the water column. Nutrients, oxygen, and particulate organic nitrogen were also measured to investigate the processes responsible for N2O production in the water column. Data on dissolved N2O has been obtained in each system from i) two-year monitoring at fixed station; ii) four seasonal samplings along the longitudinal length of the system; and iii) daily sampling in summer. The concentration of N2O ranges between 1.1 and 292.0nM indicating very high spatio-temporal variability. In general, the concentration of N2O increased during the rainy season associated with the precipitation regime that, in turn, increases the lateral inputs of organic matter and nutrients from both natural sources (discharges into rivers and adjacent marshes) and anthropogenic activities (agriculture, urban effluents and fish farming). Dissolved N2O also varied with the tides: the highest concentrations were measured during the ebb, which suggests that the systems export N2O to the Bay and adjacent Atlantic Ocean. In addition nitrification seems to be an important process for N2O formation in the water column, which also explains some of the variability in the dataset. The mean atmospheric flux of N2O reveals that entire study area was a net source of N2O to the atmosphere. The fluxes ranged between 0.5 and 313.2\textgreek{m}molm-2day-1 in the estuarine system, and between -7.2 and 97.8\textgreek{m}molm-2day-1 in the two marine systems.}

 volume = {151},
 journal = {Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science},
 abstract = {Variations in freshwater inflow have ecological consequences for estuaries ranging among eutrophication, flushing and transport, and high and low salinity impacts on biota. Predicting the potential effects of the magnitude and composition of inflow on estuaries over a range of spatial and temporal scales requires reliable mathematical models. The goal of this study was to develop and test a model of ecosystem processes with variable freshwater inflow to the sub-tropical Caloosahatchee River Estuary (CRE) in southwest Florida from 2002 to 2009. The modeling framework combined empirically derived inputs of freshwater and materials from the watershed, daily predictions of salinity, a box model for physical transport, and simulation models of biogeochemical and seagrass dynamics. The CRE was split into 3 segments to estimate advective and dispersive transport of water column constituents. Each segment contained a sub-model to simulate changes in the concentrations of organic nitrogen and phosphorus (ON and OP), ammonium (NH4+), nitrate-nitrite (NOx-), ortho-phosphate (PO4-3), phytoplankton chlorophyll a (CHL), and sediment microalgae (SM). The seaward segment also had sub-models for seagrasses (Halodule wrightii and Thalassia testudinum). The model provided realistic predictions of ON in the upper estuary during wet conditions since organic nitrogen is associated with freshwater inflow and low salinity. Although simulated CHL concentrations were variable, the model proved to be a reliable predictor in time and space. While predicted NOx- concentrations were proportional to freshwater inflow, NH4+ was less predictable due to the complexity of internal cycling during times of reduced freshwater inflow. Overall, the model provided a representation of seagrass biomass changes despite the absence of epiphytes, nutrient effects, or sophisticated translocation in the formulation. The model is being used to investigate the relative importance of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) vs. CHL in submarine light availability throughout the CRE, assess if reductions in nutrient loads are more feasible by controlling freshwater quantity or N and P concentrations, and explore the role of inflow and flushing on the fates of externally and internally derived dissolved and particulate constituents.},

In this study, we evaluated the role of continental runoff and intrusion of oceanic water masses in the trophic state of the Bay of Santa Catarina Island (BSCI) over the last three decades (1993-2019) by using multiple biogeochemical and eutrophication assessment tools. The sub-watersheds of BSCI showed high concentrations of nutrients, fecal coliform and chlorophyll-a, directly correlated to the number of inhabitants. Worst-case scenarios were found in summer and fall seasons due to sewage inputs caused by mass tourism and the inefficiency or even absence of treatment systems, boosted by strong rainfall. The intrusion of the South Atlantic Central Water and the Plata Plume Water into the BSCI favored autotrophy in the summer and heterotrophy in the winter, coupled with low and high residence time, respectively. El Ni{\~n}o events enhanced rainfall and continental runoff, exporting elevated nutrients and phytoplankton biomass loads from the eutrophic rivers to the continental shelf. The pattern reverses during La Ni{\~n}a, when chlorophyll and nutrient peaks were detected inside the bay. Eutrophication evaluation indicated that the trophic state oscillated from moderate to high and that these conditions tend to remain the same in future scenarios due to the moderate residence time of the water, anthropogenic pressures, periodic algal blooms and the intrusion of nutrient-rich oceanic water masses. Management actions, such as the improvement of the wastewater treatment system and wetlands restoration, are needed in order to mitigate eutrophication and the loss of ecosystem services and functions.}

 abstract = {We present an analysis of the global impact of microplanktonic grazers on marine phytoplankton and its implications for remineralization processes in the microbial community. The data were obtained by an extensive literature search that yielded 788 paired rate estimates of autotrophic growth ($μ$) and microzooplankton grazing (m) from dilution experiments. From studies in which phytoplankton standing stock was measured in terms of carbon equivalents, we show that the production estimate from dilution experiments is a reasonable proxy (r = 0.89) for production determined by the standard 14C method. The ratio m:$μ$, the proportion of primary production (PP) consumed by micrograzers, shows that microzooplankton consumption is the main source of phytoplankton mortality in the oceans, accounting for 67{\%} of phytoplankton daily growth for the full data set. This ratio varies modestly among various marine habitats and regions, with data averages ranging from 60{\%} for coastal and estuarine environments to 70{\%} for the open oceans, and from $\sim$59{\%} for temperate-subpolar and polar systems to 75{\%} for tropical-subtropical regions. Given estimates for the metabolic requirements of micrograzers and assuming they consume most bacterial production, regionally averaged estimates of the protistan respiration are 35-43{\%} of daily PP for the first level of consumer or 49-59{\%} of PP for three trophic transfers. The estimated contributions of microbial grazers to total community respiration are of the same magnitude as bacterial respiration. Consequently, potential ecosystem differences in micrograzer activity or trophic structure are a large uncertainty for biogeochemical models that seek to predict the microbial community role in carbon cycling from bacterial parameters alone.}

Today's technological improvements has aided biopolymer end-products to escalate to higher purposes and soon may have their performance level in par with the petroleum-based synthetic polymers. The motive of this paper is to shimmer light on some aspects of biopolymers that include its classes, properties, composites and applications. Depending on the type of class on the basis of various categories, many enthralling chemistries of polymer composition can be substantiated. Essential properties can imparted to the ensuing biopolymer by altering its chemical configuration and method of synthesis while also focusing on its functional purpose. Nowadays, biopolymer composites blend qualities of one biopolymer with another to acquire an enhanced component that showcases unique explicit attributes. There are several techniques to process biopolymer composites, of which in-situ, infiltration and electrospinning methods have captured considerable limelight. Biopolymers and its composites have embarked captivating impressions in regions of biomedical, packaging, agricultural and automotive applications. Although their efficacy is yet to reach their fossil fuel counterparts, biopolymers have laid a distinguishing mark that will continue to inspire creation of novel substances for many years to come.},

 abstract = {Agriculture and urban activities are major sources of phosphorus and nitrogen to aquatic ecosystems. Atmospheric deposition further contributes as a source of N. These nonpoint inputs of nutrients are difficult to measure and regulate because they derive from activities dispersed over wide areas of land and are variable in time due to effects of weather. In aquatic ecosystems, these nutrients cause diverse problems such as toxic algal blooms, loss of oxygen, fish kills, loss of biodiversity (including species important for commerce and recreation), loss of aquatic plant beds and coral reefs, and other problems. Nutrient enrichment seriously degrades aquatic ecosystems and impairs the use of water for drinking, industry, agriculture, recreation, and other purposes. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain that (1) eutrophication is a widespread problem in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal oceans, caused by over-enrichment with P and N; (2) nonpoint pollution, a major source of P and N to surface waters of the United States, results primarily from agriculture and urban activity, including industry; (3) inputs of P and N to agriculture in the form of fertilizers exceed outputs in produce in the United States and many other nations; (4) nutrient flows to aquatic ecosystems are directly related to animal stocking densities, and under high livestock densities, manure production exceeds the needs of crops to which the manure is applied; (5) excess fertilization and manure production cause a P surplus to accumulate in soil, some of which is transported to aquatic ecosystems; and (6) excess fertilization and manure production on agricultural lands create surplus N, which is mobile in many soils and often leaches to downstream aquatic ecosystems, and which can also volatilize to the atmosphere, redepositing elsewhere and eventually reaching aquatic ecosystems. If current practices continue, nonpoint pollution of surface waters is virtually certain to increase in the future. Such an outcome is not inevitable, however, because a number of technologies, land use practices, and conservation measures are capable of decreasing the flow of nonpoint P and N into surface waters. From our review of the available scientific information, we are confident that: (1) nonpoint pollution of surface waters with P and N could be reduced by reducing surplus nutrient flows in agricultural systems and processes, reducing agricultural and urban runoff by diverse methods, and reducing N emissions from fossil fuel burning; and (2) eutrophication can be reversed by decreasing input rates of P and N to aquatic ecosystems, but rates of recovery are highly variable among water bodies. Often, the eutrophic state is persistent, and recovery is slow.}

 abstract = {The structure of phytoplankton community was studied in a tropical macrotidal estuary (Paci{\^e}ncia river estuary), which is socially and ecologically important because is surrounded by one of the most extensive mangrove forests of the world and plays a key role in the local economy, through artisanal fishing and bivalve extraction activities in natural environments. To understand the regulation mechanisms driving the phytoplankton dynamics and the key indicator species for monitoring ecological change, the study considered seasonal and spatial analysis of environmental and biological variables in thirteen sampling points during the three seasonal periods in 2017. The ecological patterns of phytoplankton were explored by Cluster Analysis and key species were selected by the indicator value method (IndVal). From 171 identified taxa, Bacillariophyta was the most representative division (128 taxa). The phytoplankton structure was well-defined by a salinity gradient governed by rainfall and river discharge. Thus, three scenarios related to seasonality and salinity gradient were identified: tidal river zone, mixing zone and coastal zone. During the rainy and transitional seasons, it was observed a spatial gradient of salinity, characterized by the gradual increase in phytoplankton abundance and biomass from the freshwater zone towards the coastal zone, following an opposite nutrient gradient. The highest salinity and light availability (low turbidity and total particulate matter) in the dry season favored a significant growth of phytoplankton (cell abundance and biomass). Thus, the key species selected by IndVal method was Discostella stelligera, Coscinodiscus oculus-iridis and Trieres sinensis in the rainy period, Nitzschia reversa, Thalassiosira sp. and Bellerochea horologicalis in the transitional period, and Protoperidinium sp., Thalassiosira subtilis, Cyclotella striata and Thalassiosira rotula in the dry period. Hence, this work contributes to the understanding of the macrotidal estuaries functioning, reinforcing the importance of phytoplankton monitoring for the identification of ecological changes.}

 abstract = {The Clarence River Estuary is the largest estuary in southeast Australia, with an extensive floodplain encompassing multiple river channels and a large coastal lagoon. It is the focus of major commercial and recreational fisheries and there is pressure to divert its freshwater inputs for agricultural and domestic uses. We used a spatial biogeochemical model to simulate the variability and evolution of this system on timescales from days to decades over the past half century. Like most tropical and subtropical estuaries, the Clarence River Estuary is strongly influenced by river discharge, sediment and nutrient loads. Given the high nutrient loads arriving from the upper catchment, plankton biomasses in the model were typically limited by flushing through the estuary channels. However, the longer residence times of the lagoons produced a profoundly different regime where higher zooplankton concentrations were supported by recycling of nutrients and detritus. Using alternative model scenarios, it was found that the ecology of the lagoon was sensitive to changes in land-use and urbanization within the local sub-catchment, but was largely insensitive to changes in upstream river discharge (i.e. rainfall or freshwater extraction). The opposite was true in the estuary channels, where changes in land-use or urbanisation in the populated lower catchment had little effect on the estuarine ecology, while even modest reductions in river discharges dramatically increased the biomass of the smaller phytoplankton and zooplankton groups, and favoured benthic algae over seagrass and macroalgae. The contrasting responses of these 2 estuarine environments suggests the need for distinct management approaches, with stringent controls on nutrient loads into coastal lagoons and protection of environmental flows into estuary channels. {\copyright}Inter-Research 2012.}

 abstract = {Increasing eutrophication of coastal waters generates disturbances in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and emissions to the atmosphere that are still poorly documented, particularly in the tropics. Here, we investigated the concentrations and diffusive fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in the urban-dominated Jacarepagua Lagoon Complex (JLC) in Southeastern Brazil. This lagoonal complex receives highly polluted freshwater and shows frequent occurrences of anoxia and hypoxia and dense phytoplankton blooms. Between 2017 and 2018, four spatial surveys were performed (dry and wet conditions), with sampling in the river waters that drain the urban watershed and in the lagoon waters with increasing salinities. Strong oxygen depletion was found in the rivers, associated with extremely high values of partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2; up to 20,417 ppmv) and CH4 concentrations (up to 288,572 nmol L-1). These high GHG concentrations are attributed to organic matter degradation from untreated domestic effluents mediated by aerobic and anaerobic processes, with concomitant production of total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). In the lagoon, GHG concentrations decreased mainly due to dilution with seawater and degassing. In addition, the phytoplankton growth and CH4 oxidation apparently consumed some CO2 and CH4, respectively. TA concentrations showed a marked minimum at salinity of {\~{}}20 compared to the two freshwater and marine end members, indicating processes of re-oxidation of inorganic reduced species from the low-salinity region, such as ammonia, iron, and/or sulfides. Diffusive emissions of gases from the entire lagoon ranged from 22 to 48 mmol C m-2 d-1 for CO2 and from 2.2 to 16.5 mmol C m-2 d-1 for CH4. This later value is among the highest documented in coastal waters. In terms of global warming potential (GWP) and CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2-eq), the diffusive emissions of CH4 were higher than those of CO2. These results highlight that highly polluted coastal ecosystems are hotspots of GHG emissions to the atmosphere, which may become increasingly significant in future global carbon budgets.}

 abstract = {Anthropogenic eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems continues to be one of the major environmental issues worldwide and also of Brazil. Over the last five decades, several approaches have been proposed to discern the trophic state and the natural and cultural processes involved in eutrophication, including the multi-parameter Assessment of Estuarine Trophic Status (ASSETS) index model. This study applies ASSETS to four Brazilian lagoons (Munda{\'u}, Manguaba, Guarapina, and Piratininga) and one estuarine delta (Para{\'i}ba do Sul River), set along the eastern Brazilian coast. The model combines three indices based on the pressure-state-response (PSR) approach to rank the trophic status and forecast the potential eutrophication of a system, to which a final ASSETS grade is established. The lagoons were classified as being eutrophic and highly susceptible to eutrophication, due primarily to their longer residence times but also their high nutrient input index. ASSETS classified the estuary of the Para{\'i}ba do Sul river with a low to moderate trophic state (e.g., largely mesotrophic) and low susceptibility to eutrophication. Its nutrient input index was high, but the natural high dilution and flushing potential driven by river flow mitigated the susceptibility to eutrophication. Eutrophication forecasting provided more favorable trends for the Munda{\'u} and Manguaba lagoons and the Para{\'i}ba do Sul estuary, in view of the larger investments in wastewater treatment and remediation plans. The final ASSETS ranking system established the lagoons of Munda{\'u} as {\textquotedbl}moderate,{\textquotedbl} Manguaba as {\textquotedbl}bad,{\textquotedbl} Guarapina as {\textquotedbl}poor,{\textquotedbl} and Piratininga as {\textquotedbl}bad,{\textquotedbl} whereas the Para{\'i}ba do Sul River Estuary was {\textquotedbl}good.{\textquotedbl}}

 abstract = {The picoplanktonic pelagophyte Aureococcus anophagefferens could trigger harmful algal blooms (HABs) to discolor water in brown, known as brown tide. Since 2009, large-scale brown tides, caused by A. anophagefferens, had been occurred in early summer for three consecutive years in the coastal waters of Qinhuangdao, China and resulted considerable deleterious effects on the scallop mariculture industry. The causes for the occurrence of brown tides were not fully understood. Therefore, we conducted a one-year survey from June 2013 to May 2014 to study the seasonal succession of the phytoplankton community, including A. anophagefferens and its relationship with environmental variables in the area. The results revealed that the population dynamics of the phytoplankton community were significant variation with seasonal succession, in which A. anophagefferens played an important role during the entire year. The trend of the whole diversity index indicated that the community structure became more stable in winter. The results of principle component analysis (PCA) applied to the environmental factors indicated four major seasonal groups in the environmental variables. The water temperature, silicate and total nitrogen were contributed to the environment in summer, autumn and spring, respectively. In addition, a few another environmental factors commonly contributed to the winter waterbody, indicated that the aquatic environment is more complex in the cold season. The result revealed that the phytoplankton community structure and its variation were mainly affected by the hydrological factors, by using the redundancy analysis (RDA) for the relationship between dominant species and the environment. Furthermore, we inferred Chaetoceros decipiens as a potential species for the breakout of harmful algae blooms (HABs) by RDA ordination. We concluded that the key factor for the seasonal variations in the dynamics of phytoplankton community could be the hydrological parameters in Qinghuangdao coastal area. This research may provide more insight into the occurrence mechanism of brown tide.}

We observed a year-round pattern of dramatic decrease in NH4+, increase in NO3-, but insignificant change in NO2- in the upper estuary at salinity $\sim$0-5. However, species and concentrations of inorganic nitrogen at upper estuary significantly changed with season. In winter, with low runoff, the most upper reach of the Pearl River Estuary showed relatively low rates of ammonia oxidation (0-5.4 $μ$mol N L-1 d-1) and nitrite oxidation (0-5.2 $μ$mol N L-1 d-1), accompanied by extremely high concentrations of ammonia (up to {\textgreater}800 $μ$mol L-1) and nitrate (up to {\textgreater}300 $μ$mol L-1). In summer, the upper estuary showed higher nitrification rates (ammonia oxidation rate $\sim$1.5-33.1 $μ$mol N L -1 d-1, nitrite oxidation rate $\sim$0.6-32.0 $μ$mol N L-1 d-1) with lower concentrations of ammonia ({\textless}350 $μ$mol L-1) and nitrate ({\textless}120 $μ$mol L-1). The Most Probable Number test showed relatively lower nitrifier abundance in summer at most sampling stations, indicating a greater specific nitrification rate per cell in the warm season. Temperature appeared to control nitrification rates to a large degree in different seasons. Spatial variability of nitrification rates appeared to be controlled by a combination of many other factors such as nutrient concentrations, nitrifier abundance and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. In addition to aerobic respiration, nitrification contributed significantly to the consumption of DO and production of free CO2 at upper estuary. Nitrification-induced consumption accounted for up to approximately one third of the total water column community DO consumption in the upper estuary during the surveyed periods, boosting environmental stress on this large estuarine ecosystem.}

Moreover, untreated wastewater discharge and huge fresh water exploitation from industrial, residential and agricultural activities of provinces in the upstream of SaiGon and Dong Nai rivers have resulted in degradation of surface water quality. Water Stress Index (WSI) was used in this study to assess water scarcity of Ho Chi Minh City and the neighboring provinces of Dong Nai river basin. WSI of Dong Nai River basin was 13{\%} in 2010 and increasing to 23{\%} in 2025. This showed that cities of the Dong Nai river basin are under a stress of fresh water use, which may limit local economic development and require the authority of the local area to reduce the use of fresh water resource. The use of reclaimed wastewater for non-portable water demand in HCMC may reduce significantly WSI. Therefore, this paper aims to assess potential of wastewater reusein HCMC in the future.}

 abstract = {The Cross River, Calabar River, and Great Kwa River together form a network of an estuary system otherwise known as the Cross River Estuary system (CRES). Studies of dissolved nutrients and water mass dynamics were conducted mainly in February 2017. Nutrients measured included NO3$-$, NO2$-$, NH4+, dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) and dissolved silicate (DSi). The rivers were enriched with DSi and depleted of DIP. Dissolved nutrients were more elevated in the Great Kwa River than Cross River and Calabar River. The levels of DSi and DIN were less than average global concentrations, and that of river estuaries affected by anthropogenic activities. DON was the major form of TDN in the Calabar River estuary, and averagely accounted for 68--76{\%} of TDN pool, while DOP accounted for $\sim$ 54--75{\%} of TDP pool. Similarly, DON was the dominant form of TDN, and represented 75--84{\%} of TDN pool in the Cross River estuary. In contrast, TDN was dominated by DIN, which accounted for 76--84{\%} of TDN pool, while DIP accounted for 56--61{\%} of TDP pool in the Great Kwa River estuary. There was a switch from DOP (67{\%} of TDP) dominated river water to DIP (67{\%} of TDP) dominated estuarine water in the Cross River estuary, due to enrichment of DIP in the lower Cross River estuary. The adjacent shelf was dominated by DON (58{\%} of TDN) and DIP (70{\%} of TDP). Based on nutrient molar ratios, primary production was strongly limited by DIP, especially in the riverine regions, and switched to DIN limitation in the adjacent shelf. Nutrients in the CRES behaved non-conservatively, and were affected by biogeochemical and physical processes. Nutrient budgets were estimated using the classical LOICZ steady$-$state box model. Atmospheric deposition of dissolved nutrients was very limited compared to riverine supply. The exchange time of water between the CRES and adjacent sea was $\sim$ 3.5 days, and may have affected biotic processes and nutrient transport. The CRES was an important source of DIP (137 $\times$ 103 moL day$-$1), DOP (92 $\times$ 103 moL day$-$1) and DON (4849 $\times$ 103 moL day$-$1) to the adjacent shelf, which was respectively 7, 4 and 2 times higher than the total riverine input. The ecosystem metabolism of the CRES, inferred from the $Δ$DIPsystem and $Δ$DINsystem indicated that respiration of organic matter was higher than primary production with respiration rate of $-$15.7 $\times$ 106 mol C day$-$1 ($-$58 mmol C m$-$2 day$-$1), while nitrogen metabolism was $-$3.8 $\times$ 106 mol N day$-$1 ($-$14 mmol N m$-$2 d$-$1), suggesting that the CRES was heterotrophic, and denitrifying more than nitrogen fixation during this study.}

 abstract = {The Tubul-Raqui estuary is a coastal system off central Chile at 37°S, adjacent to an active coastal upwelling area, which undergoes rapid changes associated with natural and anthropogenic perturbations. Biogenic greenhouse gas cycling and the gas saturation levels are good indicators of microbial metabolism and trophic status in estuaries. The dissolved greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O and other biological and chemical variables were spatially recorded in this estuary over two seasons (summer and winter) and over one-half of one tidal cycle. Tidal and spatial variability of these gases indicated they had different origins within the system. Surface waters were always oversaturated in CO2 (up to 578{\%}) and CH4 (up to 6200{\%}) with respect to the atmosphere. But while CO2 seems to come from marine and in situ metabolism, CH4 appears to be more influenced by fluvial and adjacent salt marsh areas. In contrast, N2O was mostly undersaturated and sediments seem to be largely responsible for its consumption. Strong seasonal variability was also observed in CO2 and CH4 fluxes, being tenfold (from-319 to 714mmolm-2d-1) and fivefold (from 0.33 to 2.5mmolm-2d-1) higher, respectively, in the austral summer compared to winter. In contrast, only small seasonal differences in N2O fluxes were found ranging from -59 to 28 $μ$mol m-2 d-1. These temporal patterns can be explained not only in terms of hydrological and nutrient balances within the system, but also by the influence of wind-driven upwelling processes. Additionally, potential effects of changes in nutrient load and freshwater discharge on net ecosystem metabolism (i.e., autotrophy or heterotrophy) and therefore, on the production/removal of greenhouse gases in this system were explored. {\copyright}2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Understanding its variability across short time scales in estuaries may help ecologists understand seasonal and diurnal migration of estuarine organisms, and answer how their nutritional requirements are fulfilled. It may also inform biogeochemists regarding the factors that influence import and export of nutrients between terrestrial and coastal ecosystems. This study aimed to link the dynamics of fatty acids, stable isotopes ($δ$13C and $δ$15N) and C/N ratios of SPM, revealing organic matter quality, to rapidly varying factors (SPM concentration, salinity and presence of daylight) and comparing this variability to the seasonal variation induced by the alternation of dry and wet seasons in the studied region. Our results revealed that these rapidly varying factors had a strong influence on the bacterial and the phytoplanktonic compartments of SPM. They suggest that tidally resuspended particles are the site of intense heterotrophic activity and that estuarine phytoplankton store lipids during the daytime up to substantially modifying SPM quality. Our study also shows higher freshness of SPM during the wet season. We expect this study to raise the interest of both biologists and biogeochemists to introduce daily variability of SPM in food webs and nutrient budgets modelling.}

 journal = {Global Change Biology},
 abstract = {Fresh waters make a disproportionately large contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with shallow lakes being particular hot spots. Given their global prevalence, how GHG fluxes from shallow lakes are altered by climate change may have profound implications for the global carbon cycle. Empirical evidence for the temperature dependence of the processes controlling GHG production in natural systems is largely based on the correlation between seasonal temperature variation and seasonal change in GHG fluxes. However, ecosystem-level GHG fluxes could be influenced by factors, which while varying seasonally with temperature are actually either indirectly related (e.g. primary producer biomass) or largely unrelated to temperature, for instance nutrient loading. Here, we present results from the longest running shallow-lake mesocosm experiment which demonstrate that nutrient concentrations override temperature as a control of both the total and individual GHG flux. Furthermore, testing for temperature treatment effects at low and high nutrient levels separately showed only one, rather weak, positive effect of temperature (CH4 flux at high nutrients). In contrast, at low nutrients, the CO2 efflux was lower in the elevated temperature treatments, with no significant effect on CH4 or N2 O fluxes. Further analysis identified possible indirect effects of temperature treatment. For example, at low nutrient levels, increased macrophyte abundance was associated with significantly reduced fluxes of both CH4 and CO2 for both total annual flux and monthly observation data. As macrophyte abundance was positively related to temperature treatment, this suggests the possibility of indirect temperature effects, via macrophyte abundance, on CH4 and CO2 flux. These findings indicate that fluxes of GHGs from shallow lakes may be controlled more by factors indirectly related to temperature, in this case nutrient concentration and the abundance of primary producers. Thus, at ecosystem scale, response to climate change may not follow predictions based on the temperature dependence of metabolic processes.}

 abstract = {Human poisoning by microcystin has been recorded in many countries, including Brazil, where fatal cases have already occurred. The Amazon River is the main source of drinking water in municipalities such as Macap{\'a}, where there is no monitoring of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins. This study investigated the presence of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins in samples from a drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) that catches water from the Amazon River. The toxin analyses employed ELISA, LC/MS, and molecular screening for genes involved in the production of cyanotoxins. The sampling was carried out monthly from April 2015 to April 2016 at the intake (raw water) and exit (treated water) of the DWTP. This study reports the first detection of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) in the Amazon River, the world's largest river, and in its treated water destined for drinking water purposes in Macap{\'a}, Brazil. The cyanobacterial density and MC-LR concentration were both low during the year. However, Limnothrix planctonica showed a density peak ($\pm$ 900 cells mL(-1)) in the quarter of June-August 2015, when MC-LR was registered (2.1 µg L(-1)). Statistical analyses indicate that L. planctonica may produce the microcystin.},

To help avoid confusion between these concepts, this paper provides clear definitions of the residence time and the influence time. The similarities and differences between them are illustrated using both a simplified 1D advection-diffusion model and a realistic two-dimensional model of the Scheldt Estuary (Belgium and the Netherlands).The residence time of a water parcel in a control domain is the time taken by this parcel to leave the control domain for the first time. The influence time is the time required to replace the water in the domain of interest by renewing water. For steady flows, the influence time is numerically identical to the age of the renewing water, but the two timescales differ for unsteady flows.The residence time measures the influence of a hypothetical point discharge on a control domain. In environmental studies, it provides a measure of the effectiveness of hydrodynamic processes at helping a semi-enclosed basin to recover from a local pollution event. The influence time quantifies the local influence of a tracer that would be uniformly distributed in the control domain at the initial time. It is therefore a relevant diagnostic tool in impact studies focusing on the local persistence of a pollution problem initially affecting a large domain. {\copyright}2013 Elsevier B.V.}

We assembled the largest global dataset to date on emission rates of all three GHGs and found they covary with lake size and trophic state. Fitted models were upscaled to estimate global emission using global lake size inventories and a remotely-sensed global lake productivity distribution. Traditional upscaling approaches overestimated CO2 and N2O emission but underestimated CH4 by half. Our upscaled size-productivity weighted estimates (1.25-2.30 Pg of CO2-equivalents annually) are nearly 20{\%} of global CO2 fossil fuel emission with {\~{}}75{\%} of the climate impact due to CH4. Moderate global increases in eutrophication could translate to 5-40{\%} increases in the GHG effects in the atmosphere, adding the equivalent effect of another 13{\%} of fossil fuel combustion or an effect equal to GHG emissions from current land use change.}

 abstract = {Metal pollution is a global problemin estuaries due to the legacy of historic contamination and currently increasing metal emissions. However, the establishment of water and sediment standards or management actions in brackish systems has been difficult because of the inherent transdisciplinary nature of estuarine processes. According to the European Commission, integrative comprehension of fate and effects of contaminants in different compartments of these transitional environments (estuarine sediment, water, biota) is still required to better establish, assess and monitor the good ecological status targeted by the Water Framework Directive. Thus, the present study proposes a holistic overview and conceptual model for the environmental fate of metals and their toxicity effects on aquatic organisms in estuaries. This includes the analysis and integration of biogeochemical processes and parameters, metal chemistry and organism physiology. Sources of particulate and dissolved metal, hydrodynamics, water chemistry, and mechanisms of toxicity are discussed jointly in a multidisciplinary manner. It is also hypothesized how these different drivers of metal behaviour might interact and affect metal concentrations in diverse media, and the knowledge gaps and remaining research challenges are pointed. Ultimately, estuarine physicochemical gradients, biogeochemical processes, and organismphysiology are jointly coordinating the fate and potential effects of metals in estuaries, and both realistic model approaches and attemptsto postulate site-specific water criteria or water/sediment standards must consider such interdisciplinary interactions.}

In this work, spatial and temporal patterns of phytoplankton in the Tucuru{\'i} reservoir, Par{\'a} State, Brazil, were studied by following a computer modeling approach. A water quality model was coupled to a 3-D hydrodynamic model. Simulations were carried out in low and high rainfall periods, by using MOHID, a process-oriented modeling system. Modeling results were compared to field data over a 1-year period (1 July 2010-1 July 2011). Field data included water and air temperature, wind, relative humidity, radiation, cloud cover, nitrate, ammonia, phosphorus, and dissolved oxygen. Water flow data were used at the reservoir's inlet and outlet as forcings for simulations. The results indicated that Tucuru{\'i} reservoir is a phosphorus limited system, and that phytoplankton growth is limited by hydrodynamics, due to the different nutrients load in low and high rainfall periods over the year. Moreover, modeling results showed that the chlorophyll a is a key factor to define the system's trophic status, since the nutrients may be in excess in the system and can trigger algal blooms. The model enabled a comprehensive understanding of system for developing the best management policy for algal blooms in Tucuru{\'i} reservoir. {\copyright}2012 Elsevier B.V.},

A significant difference was found in phytoplankton distribution among stations and seasons with (i) maximum proliferation in the inner parts of the lagoon, (ii) spring-winter association of the majority of species including the dominant harmful species Prorocentrum micans and (iii) summer diatom proliferation. Redundancy analysis indicates that temperature and nutrients have a substantial effect on distribution. Epiphyte distribution roughly follows the development cycle of R. cirrhosa.

 pages = {279--291},
 volume = {56},

 journal = {Limnol. Oceanogr.},
 abstract = {We measured benthic denitrification (DN) and dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium (DNRA) using the isotope-pairing technique in three tropical estuaries in Thailand (Mae Klong), Indonesia (Cisadane), and Fiji (Vunidawa-Rewa) during rainy, dry, and intermediate seasons along the salinity gradient of each estuary. DNRA dominated. Anammox (AN) was measured initially but neither AN activity nor AN bacteria-related 16S ribosomal RNA genes were detected in any of the estuaries. DN was either zero or extremely low, driven by water column nitrate and not from benthic nitrification-DN. N2O was not formed during DN. N2O saturations in estuary water were low, except in the nutrified Indonesian estuary, and tropical estuaries are therefore likely to be only small sources of N2O. Benthic nitrate reduction was nitrate limited; when nitrate was enhanced experimentally, DN increased slightly, but DNRA increased proportionately much more. Predominance of DNRA over DN in tropical estuaries may be due both to an energetic advantage (greater standard free energy change, $Δ$Gu) of nitrate ammonifiers over denitrifiers when competing for limited nitrate, and also to higher affinity for nitrate by the nitrate ammonifiers. At tropical temperatures the three processes occur in the order DNRA {\textgreater}DN {\textgreater}AN. In contrast, temperate estuaries, at lower temperature and higher nitrate concentrations, exhibit proportionately greater levels of AN and DN. The Cisadane estuary became anoxic during the dry season, with high ammonium and sulfide, but no nitrate reduction because of lack of nitrate. Addition of nitrate stimulated high rates of autotrophic DN driven by sulfide, but not DNRA. {\copyright}2011, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.}

 abstract = {An integrated water management model has been proposed to investigate the water resources planning and management problem for a tidal basin having a complex reservoir-river network system. The model addresses an optimal operating policy for the interlinked reservoir system, hydropower plant and water-treatment facilities as well as the irrigation systems that utilize both surface water and ground-water to obtain the optimum benefit from the water supply, agriculture and hydropower production. The integrated water-management model is, essentially, a linkage between the optimization model and the hydrodynamic flow and transport model. A modified constraint approach is suggested to incorporate the implicit nonlinear salinity constraints in the optimization model. The present model has been applied to the Lower Dong Nai River Basin, and two scenarios for water resources planning and management have been analysed. The results showed that the energy production of Tri An hydropower plant will reduce significantly as the water supply has to meet the increase in water demands for irrigation and public use during the low-flow period by the year 2010. Consequently, the construction of Phuoc Hoa Reservoir and its diversion channel to Dau Tieng Reservoir will improve the effectiveness of this system's operation. With this additional system component implementation, the power production requirement could be maintained. Also the total water requirement up to the year 2010 is satisfied, and the area of cultivation could be increased for agricultural development.}

With an average discharge of 26.2 m3/s, the Nhue River receives about 5.8 m3/s of untreated domestic water from the city's main open-air-sewer - the To Lich River. The studies during 2002-2003 showed high concentrations of BOD (70 mg O2/l), DOC (15 mg C/l), coliform (2.4e6 MNP/100 ml), total phosphorus (3.5 mg P/l), and total nitrogen (31.6 mg N/l) in the To Lich, while DO level was less than 1 mg O2/l. Such high loads of untreated wastewater impacted water quality in the Nhue River where DO decreased at times to as low as 1 mg O2/l. The accumulation of particulate organic matter and micro-organisms in the sediments of the Nhue represented substantial sources of nutrients and sinks for DO. They are also considerable production of dissolved carbon dioxide at concentrations up to two orders of magnitude higher than pressure. Such pressures (EpCO2) are expected in polluted environments, but the results presented here are new for Vietnam and much of developing countries. A number of factors linked to field monitoring and laboratory measurements clearly indicate the importance of autotrophic over heterotrophic biological processes and sediments. An ecological model for management purposes has been developed that reliably estimates of the pollutant loads. An opportunity was taken to examine the changing impacts and processes when the To Lich was diverted from the Nhue. The monitoring and modelling of this opportunity showed low dissolved oxygen levels even if the impact from the To Lich was lessened. Alternatives are proposed to alleviate problems of water quality in the Nhue. It is concluded that the treatment of the To Lich River's water is highly recommended; otherwise a reduction to one third of current wastewater discharge is needed to bring water quality back to the environmental standard. {\copyright}2006 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {Algal assemblages have been widely used as an ecological indicator of aquatic ecosystem health conditions because of their specific sensitivity to a wide variety of environmental conditions. In turbid rivers, as in other aquatic systems, phytoplankton structure plays an important role in structuring aquatic food webs. Worldwide, phytoplankton is less studied in turbid, large tropical rivers compared to temperate river systems. The present study aimed to describe the phytoplankton diversity and abundance in a turbid tropical river (the Red River, northern part of Vietnam from 20°00 to 25°30 North; from 100°00 to 107°10 East)and to determine the importance of a series of environmental variables in controlling the phytoplankton community composition. Phytoplankton community was composed of 169 phytoplankton taxa from six algal groups including Bacillariophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Cryptophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Dinophyceae and Cyanobacteria. Community composition varied both spatially and with season. Sixteen measurement environmental variables were used as input variables for a three-layer backpropagation neural network that was developed to predict the phytoplankton abundance. Phytoplankton abundance was successfully predicted using the tagsig transfer function and the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm. The network was trained to provide a good overall linear fit to the total data set with a slope (R)and mean square error (MSE)of 0.808 and 0.0107, respectively. The sensitivity analysis and neutral interpretation diagram revealed that total phosphorus (TP), flow discharge, water temperature and P-PO43$-$ were the significant variables. The results showed that the developed ANN model was able to simulate phytoplankton abundance in the Red River. These findings can help for gaining insight into and the relationship between phytoplankton and environmental factors in this complex, turbid, tropical river.}

Large rivers (V) largely bypass the nearshore filter, while karstic (VI) and arheic coasts (VII) act as inactive filters. This typology provides new insight into the spatial distribution and inherent heterogeneity of estuarine filters worldwide. The relative importance of each type at the global scale is calculated and types I, II, III and IV account for 32{\%}, 22{\%}, 8{\%} and 26{\%} of the global coastline, respectively, while 12{\%} have a very limited nearshore coastal filter. As an application of this typology, the global estuarine surface area is re-estimated to 1.1 $\times$ 106 km2 instead of 1.4 $\times$ 106 km2 in earlier work. {\copyright}2011 The Author(s).}

The objectives of the MAGEST survey program are to establish a reference database to improve the knowledge of the Gironde Estuary functioning, encompassing the aspects of hydrology, sediment dynamics and biogeochemistry. Through examples of results from intratidal to seasonal time scales, we demonstrate how such a long-term, high-frequency monitoring of a fluvio-estuarine system is of valuable interest to extract the main trends of its functioning and of the water quality in relation to external forcings (climatology, urban wastes, land use, ...) and to predict the future evolution of an estuary with global and environmental changes.}

Although estuaries from the different regions have a number of unifying features, such as salinity gradients, tidal variations and terrestrial inputs they also have a number of important differences. The most distinct of these is the timing and variability of the major physical forclngs on the estuary (e.g., river flow, insolation). The three tropical estuaries were much more episodic than their temperate counterparts, with a much more dynamic salinity sH'nctnre and more variable riverwater concentrations, so that delivery of material to the estuary is dominated by short-lived flood events. In contrast, seawater concentrations were more stable in the tropical estuaries due to a more constant input of insolation, resulting in year round biological activity. There was biological removal of dissolved inorganic phosphorus in the low salinity region of the tropical Jardine and Daintree estuaries and a low salinity input of nitrate in the tropical Annan estuary most likely due to nitrification in the bottom sediments, and the biological reaction zone in the tropical Annan Estuary was flushed out of the estuarine basin to the edge of the offshore plume during a flood. Similar effects were not seen in the temperate Inverness, Cromarty, and Dornoch Firths. Similarities between estuaries include mid-estuary inputs of ammonium which were seen in both the temperate and tropical estuaries, although they occur under vastly contrasting conditions of low river discharge and periods of flood, respectively. Five of the estuaries show a general increase in dissolved inorganic phosphorus concentrations towards the sea during low flows, reflecting their pristine condition, and all six estuaries had low salinity silicate maxima probably sourced from the dissolution of freshwater biogenic silicate that has been carried seaward, except in the tropical estuaries during the dry season when a benthic source is proposed.

 pages = {61--83},
 volume = {205},
 journal = {Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser.},
 abstract = {Nutrient transformation and phytoplankton growth were examined in 9 river-dominated sub-tropical east Australian estuaries in 1996 using modified mixing diagrams. The sampling program was rapid and strictly controlled, using 2 or 3 boats simultaneously, so that all 9 estuaries were usually sampled within 4 to 5 d of each other. River samples were collected at the head of each estuary on a flow-weighted basis, and variations in river concentrations and flushing times were used to calculate conservative mixing lines. This was to avoid 'apparent' non-linear distributions in the mixing diagrams associated with river-source variations on a time scale less or equal to the flushing time of the estuary. A number of general patterns of biogeochemical behaviour were observed across most, or all, of the estuaries. The 4 northern, and most likely the 5 southern, estuaries flushed fresh to the mouth during a flood in May, allowing most of the flood-borne material to escape from the system. Phytoplankton appear to exert the dominant control on nutrient transformation in the 9 estuaries, with non-biological processes only playing a minor role, if any. Eight of the 9 estuaries are potentially nutrient-limited, with nutrient concentrations falling below the upper half-saturation constants required for phytoplankton growth. The estuaries became potentially more P-limited, and less N-limited, as the wastewater loading to each system increased. During most sampling runs, maximum and mean concentrations of phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) in the Tweed, Brunswick, Bellinger, Nambucca, Macleay and Hastings estuaries were significantly correlated with the wastewater DIN (dissolved inorganic nitrogen) loading index (daily wastewater load per m3 of estuary volume multiplied by the flushing time of the estuary in days). In contrast, the diffuse DIN loading index appeared more important for controlling phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) in the 3 estuaries (Richmond, Clarence and Manning) that received a low wastewater DIN load. Sub-tropical Australian estuaries are characterised by a high degree of variability in nutrient delivery and phytoplankton growth. The timing and magnitude of hydrological factors appears to be the major feature that determines the differences in the temporal patterns of phytoplankton growth between sub-tropical and temperate regions. Nutrient-loading and phytoplankton growth in the 9 estuaries appears to be in phase, suggesting that stored and recycled nutrients may play a smaller role in maintaining phytoplankton growth in these systems compared to the larger partially mixed temperate systems. Management efforts in the 9 estuaries should be first directed towards reducing the wastewater DIN loading index to {\textless}1, followed by management strategies focused on controlling diffuse loadings. There may, however, be a trade-off associated with reducing the wastewater loading index with a proportional reduction in fisheries production.}

Such a model can substitute expensive conventional techniques for assessing remote water quality. A set of equations connecting sensors 5 TM and 8 OLI were generated using multiple regression analysis. Radiometric and atmospheric corrections were carried out to enhance the quality of satellite images. Total 13 compositions of different bands including blue, green and red were considered to find the Coefficient of Determination (r2) with the field level EC (electrical conductivity) values collected from 74 sampling locations. Salinity data mainly EC values of coastal water were collected from primary and secondary sources. Considering the r2 values, significant band compositions were identified and then employed to generate linear equations. Such equation for Landsat 5 TM could detect water salinity (i.e. EC) accurately of around 82{\%}. Similarly, the r2 value for Landsat 8 OLI was found as 0.76 that can confirm the applicability of Landsat data series to detect the change of salinity level of coastal water for a long period. The availability of coastal water was delineated by NDWI whereas salinity level was assessed using the developed equations for the year 2001 and 2019. Interestingly, it was observed that coastal areas having lower level of EC almost vanished whereas those of having higher level of EC were increased significantly between 2001 and 2019. Such increase in coastal water salinity is the result of combined effects of climatic and anthropogenic factors, which can pose a considerable risk to the coastal inhabitants including freshwater scarcity, food insecurity, and health hazard.}

 number = {1},
 journal = {Estuaries},
 abstract = {A combination of mixing plots, one-dimensional sah balance modelling, nutrient loading budgets, and benthic flux measurements were used to assess nutrient cycling pathways in the enriched sub-tropical Brunswick estuary during different freshwater flows. A simple model accounting for freshwater residence times and nutrient availability was found to be a good predictor of phytoplankton biomass along the estuary, and suggested that biomass accumulation may become nutrient-limited during low flows and that recycling within the water column is important during blooms. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) cycling budgets were constructed for the estuary during different freshwater flows accounting for all major inputs (catchment, sewage, and urban) to the estuary. Internal cycling due to phytoplankton uptake (based on measured biomass) and sediment-water fluxes (based on measured rates in each estuarine reach) was considered. Four different nutrient cycling states were identified during the study. In high flow, freshwater residence times are less than 1 d, internal cycling processes are bypassed and virtually all dissolved, and most particulate, nutrients are delivered to the continental shelf. During the growth phase of a phytoplankton bloom enhanced recycling occurs as residence times increase sufficiently to allow biomass accumulation. Remineralization of phytoplankton detritus during this phase can supply up to 50{\%} of phytoplankton DIN demands. In post-bloom conditions, DIN uptake by phytoplankton decreases in the autumn wet season when biomass doubling times begin to exceed residence times. OM supply to the sediments diminishes and the benthos becomes nutrient-limited, resulting in DIN uptake by the sediments. As flows decrease further in the dry season, there is tight recycling and phytoplankton blooms, and uptake by the sediments can account for the entire DIN loading to the estuary resulting in complete removal of DIN from the water column. The ocean is a potentially important source of DIN to the estuary at this time. The results of the DIN cycling budgets compared favorably with mixing plots of DIN at each time. The results suggest that a combination of different approaches maybe useful in developing a more comprehensive understanding of nutrient cycling behavior and the effects of nutrient enrichment in estuaries.}

 journal = {Aquat. Microb. Ecol.},
 abstract = {Diurnal benthic fluxes of dissolved inorganic and organic nitrogen (DIN and DON) and dinitrogen gas (N2) were measured in euphotic sediments of 3 shallow sub-tropical Australian estuaries during 4 seasons. The estuaries included 2 impacted by sewage effluent (Brunswick and Simpsons estuaries) and 1 relatively pristine system (Sandon estuary). Sediments acted predominantly as net sinks of DIN throughout the year, except in the nutrient-enriched upper reaches of the Brunswick estuary, where large effluxes of NH4+ occurred during the summer wet season. Distinct light/dark variations in NH4+ fluxes with reduced effluxes or reversal to uptakes occurred during the light in productive sediments. NO 3- was predominantly taken up by sediments at rates proportional to ambient concentrations in the water column. DON commonly comprised a major fraction of fluxes and was controlled primarily by heterotrophic processes in the upper to middle estuaries and autotrophic processes in the lower estuaries. Large deficits in the amount of remineralised DIN (assuming the breakdown of 'Redfield' algae) indicated that a significant amount of nitrogen is either denitrified or immobilised in biomass in the sediments. Benthic fluxes of N2 suggest that denitrification accounts for a relatively small fraction of the missing nitrogen and immobilisation in biomass (and flow up the food chain) is a potentially major pathway of nitrogen removal in these estuaries. Significant rates of benthic productivity also stimulated secondary heterotrophic production, promoting competition for nutrient resources in the sediments. The highest rates of DIN uptake coincided with maximum metabolic rates in sediments where the diurnal p/r (gross productivity/respiration) was between 0.5 and 1, suggesting a peak in competition at this metabolic state. Denitrification rates were lowest at p/r 0.5 to 1 and strongly related to uptake of DIN from the water column, suggesting that competition may cause NO3- limitation in these euphotic sediments. Dissimilatory NO3- reduction to ammonium may become relatively more important as water column oxygen saturation drops below 40{\%}, a condition that occurs regularly in the upper Brunswick estuary. NH4+ was only effluxed in net heterotrophic sediments (p/r {\textless}1), while fluxes tended towards zero in net autotrophic sediments (p/r {\textgreater}1). A conceptual model for benthic nutrient cycling in shallow sub-tropical estuaries is proposed whereby benthic productivity favours to the immobilisation of nitrogen in biomass at the expense of denitrification and recycling back to the water column.}

Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that variation in the dataset was best explained by 2 components representing heterotrophic and autotrophic processes respectively. Heterotrophic respiration was most closely associated with sediment chlorophyll c, indicating that benthic labile organic carbon (OC) was dominated by phytodetritus (diatoms) and viable phytoplankton cells. The supply of this OC to the sediments was controlled by a combination of phytoplankton biomass and hydrodynamic circulation patterns. Autotrophic benthic production across the study area was closely associated with light attenuation, which varied according to depth and turbidity. DIN fluxes were most closely associated with the autotrophic component, indicating the importance of N assimilation by benthic microalgae. N2 fluxes were negatively associated with the heterotrophic component, most likely due to the increasing inhibition of coupled nitrification-denitrification and/or an increase in N fixation as OC loading increases. DON fluxes dominated N fluxes overall and were controlled by autotrophic/heterotrophic DON production and heterotrophic DON consumption. Cluster analysis identified 3 basic states that describe the spatial and temporal variation in benthic processes across western Moreton Bay: reactive nearshore sediments underlying phytoplankton bloom centres (Cluster 1), less reactive sediments further offshore which receive a lesser supply of phytodetritus (Cluster 2) and a new suite of sediment properties, metabolism and N fluxes at the nearshore sites following a post-flood phytoplankton bloom (Cluster 3). {\copyright}Inter-Research 2007.}

 abstract = {The Assessment of Estuarine Trophic Status (ASSETS) screening model has been extended to allow its application to both estuarine and coastal systems. The model, which combines elements of pressure, state and response, was tested on four systems: Maryland Coastal Bays and Long Island Sound in the United States and The Firth of Clyde (Scotland) and Tagus Estuary (Portugal) in the European Union. The overall scores were: Maryland Coastal Bays: Bad; Firth of Clyde: Poor; Tagus Estuary: Good. Long Island Sound was modelled along a timeline, using 1991 data (score: Bad) and 2002 data (score: Moderate). The improvement registered for Long Island Sound is a consequence of the reduction in nutrient loading, and the ASSETS score changed accordingly. The two main areas where developments are needed are (a) In the definition of type-specific ranges for eutrophication parameters, due to the recognition that natural or pristine conditions may vary widely, and the use of a uniform set of thresholds artificially penalizes some systems and potentially leads to misclassification; (b) In the definition and quantification of measures which will result in an improved state through a change in pressures, as well as in the definition of appropriate metrics through which response may be assessed. One possibility is the use of detailed research models where different response scenarios potentially produce changes in pressure and state. These outputs may be used to drive screening models and analyze the suitability of candidate metrics for evaluating management options.}

The hydrodynamic model was calibrated and validated considering the following main forces: fresh water flow, astronomical and meteorological tides in the oceanic boundary, and wind acting on the water surface. A series of water levels measured at six coastal stations and vertical profiles of current velocity measured at four different locations in the estuarine zone of the R{\'i}o de la Plata were used for calibrating and validating the hydrodynamic model. The calibration process was carried out in two steps. First the astronomical waves propagation was calibrated comparing harmonic constants of observed and computed sea surface elevation data. Next, both the astronomical and meteorological wave propagation was calibrated. Direct comparison of scatter plot and root-mean square errors of model results and field data were used when evaluating the calibration quality. The calibrated model shows good agreement with the measured water surface level in the entire domain with mean error values being minor than 20{\%} of the measured data and correlation factors higher than 0.74. Also, the intensity and velocity direction observed in the currents data are well represented by the model in both bottom and surface levels with errors similar to 30{\%} of the currents data components. Using the 3D calibrated model the bottom and surface residual circulation for a four month period of time was analyzed. {\copyright}2012 Elsevier Inc.},

 abstract = {Coastal marine ecosystems are generally considered important sources of nitrous oxide (N2O), a powerful greenhouse gas and ozone depleting substance. To date most studies have focused on the environmental factors controlling N2O production although N2O uptake has been observed in a variety of coastal ecosystems. In this study, we examined sediment fluxes of N2O during 2 years (2012-2013) in a shallow temperate estuary (Waquoit Bay, MA, USA). Overall sediments were a net N2O sink (-23 $\pm$ 5.2 nmol m-2 h-1, mean $\pm$ SE, significantly less than zero p {\textless}0.0001). N2O fluxes were significantly correlated to water column dissolved N2O ({\%} saturation; p {\textless}0.0001), inorganic phosphorus (DIP; p = 0.0017), and nitrogen (DIN; p = 0.0019), as well as to temperature (p = 0.0192). Additionally, there was a positive correlation between sediment N2O uptake and both oxygen (O2) and DIP uptake (p = 0.0002 and p {\textless}0.0001, O2 and DIP sediment uptake, respectively). Results from this study indicate that sediments in shallow coastal ecosystems can be a strong sink of dissolved N2O, and therefore may mitigate N2O efflux to the atmosphere and export to the coastal ocean. Establishing the nature and strength of relationships between environmental conditions and sediment N2O fluxes moves us toward better-constrained models that will improve ecosystem management strategies, N2O budgets, and our ability to predict the response of coastal ecosystems to local and global change.}

 abstract = {Exposure time is an important characteristic for hydrodynamics that has simultaneous impacts on the biochemical processes in tidal systems. To eliminate man-made errors, decrease computational effort, and increase simulation efficiency, exposure time was evaluated under different hydrodynamic conditions for a bay to investigate the impact of the external domain on the accuracy of the computational results for exposure time. The exposure time was explicitly defined and computed using a hydrodynamic model and tracer experiments for a set of ten external domain sizes (EDS), five external domain lengths (EDL), and three special hydrodynamic conditions. The results indicated that the external domain had a significant influence on the exposure time, and the intensity of this influence was related to hydrodynamic conditions. The sensitivity of the exposure time to the external domain increased with increasing tidal range, while freshwater inflows decreased this sensitivity. However, the variation trends for exposure time with different EDS and EDL were independent of the hydrodynamic conditions. Considering the computational efficiency (maximum), the calculated error (minimum) of the exposure time, and the impact of the boundary conditions (minimum), the recommended EDS and EDL range from 9 to 13 times the initial domain size and 1.30 to 1.45 times the length in the bay, respectively. The research regarding exposure time and external domains not only helps to eliminate the errors caused by man-made factors and reduce the computational effort but also provides a reference for understanding the interrelationship between coastal waters, reciprocating flow, and the water environment.}

 abstract = {The Danube catchment basin (817 000 km2, 76 $\times$ 106 inhabitants) is the major freshwater contributor to the Black Sea (6300 m3 s-1, 80{\%} of the annual river discharge into the north-western Black Sea). The aim of the modelling approach developed for the Danube River, is to establish how land use and management of the whole watershed are linked to nutrient (N, P, Si) delivery and retention by the river. The approach uses an adaptation of the RIVERSTRAHLER model, which is based on a schematic representation of the drainage network deduced from geomorphological analysis by stream orders. The whole catchment was divided into 10 sub-basins and one branch, to provide a description satisfying both the need to take into account the heterogeneity of the system and the availability of constraints and validation data. On the basis of this description, a hydrological model was developed, which adequately simulated the seasonal variations of the discharge measured at the outlet of the basin. The model itself resulted from the coupling of the hydrological model with a biogeochemical model (RIVE), which takes into account the main ecological processes. It established a link between microscopic processes, their controlling factors and their macroscopic manifestations in terms of nutrient cycling and ecological functioning at the scale of the whole drainage network. The model was validated for the period from 1988 to 1991 on the basis of available observations of the major water-quality variables involved in the eutrophication processes (inorganic nutrients, phytoplankton biomass, dissolved oxygen, etc.). A reasonable agreement was found between the simulations of the model and the observations. Nutrient fluxes to the Black Sea, calculated for our reference period, are in the same range as those obtained via other approaches. Si/P and N/P ratios suggest silicon, rather than phosphorus, limitation for diatoms and phosphorus, rather than nitrogen, limitation for overall phytoplankton in the coastal zone of the Black Sea. The sharp drop in N and P delivery to the Black Sea, observed since 1991, was simulated with a scenario constructed to reproduce new constraints based on documented modifications of human activity in the watershed. Due to the scarcity of data, there is a need for further validation of the model. Nevertheless, the structure of the model allows the specificity of each sub-basin to be taken into account in future management plans. {\copyright}2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}

Limnology and Oceanography. 40: 750-765), has been developed to describe nutrient (N, P, Si) transfer processes at the scale of the whole Seine Basin taking into account human activities such as agricultural practices, waterscape and urban wastewater management. Whereas the upstream basin is strongly influenced by intensive agriculture, leading to high nitrate concentrations, the lower Seine River and estuary are densely populated. Paris and its suburbs represent alone up to 60{\%} of the population in the basin (10.106 inhabitants), causing large amounts of ammonium to be released by domestic effluents discharged downstream from Paris (of which the Ach{\`e}res wastewater treatment plant -WWTP- treated up to 80{\%}). The ammonium loading is completely nitrified in the upstream fluvial estuary (300 km farther the effluent outlet), which leads to a strong oxygen deficit in summer. A conceptual representation of nitrification was constructed in which microbial compartments were taken explicitly into account, and the intermediate production of N2O included. On this basis a physiological analysis of the two stages of the nitrification by nitrifying bacteria (ammonium and nitrite oxidizing bacteria) was carried out, as a function of the controlling factors (O2, NH 4+ , NO 2- ; Brion, N. {\&} G.

A mathematical formulation of the kinetics and the parameters values were incorporated into the general model of ecological functioning of the fluvial sector and freshwater estuary of the Seine River. N2O emissions due to denitrification were also considered. Results from summer field studies between 1998 and 2003 were used to validate the model which is able to reproduce the main spatial and temporal patterns of the activities of the microbial nitrifying communities as well as the levels of oxygen and nitrogen forms (NH 4+ , NO 2- , NO 3- N2O). Once validated, the model is used to examine the planned installation of a tertiary treatment at the Ach{\`e}res WWTP, scheduled for 2007 (a 90{\%} reduction by nitrification of the presently discharged ammonium, and a 30{\%} reduction of the nitrate by denitrification). The model shows that a nitrification treatment leads to a significant improvement in the oxygenation and a reduction of N2O emission. However, only further denitrification of urban effluents, expected in 2015, would significantly reduce the nitrogen delivery to the coastal zone. {\copyright}2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.}

 abstract = {Organic matter was studied in the turbidity maximum zone (TMZ) of the Seine Estuary during 8 tidal cycles from April to October in 2001, 2002 and 2003, covering a salinity range from 0 to 27. The hydrological conditions were quite varied (extremely wet in 2001, unusually dry in 2003). A particularly striking feature is the high organic matter content in the suspended solids (SS) of the Seine estuary (4-5{\%}). By determining micro-organism activity and organic carbon partitioning, either linked to particles or in dissolved forms, and estimating the TMZ water volumes, together with SS, we extrapolated these activities and stocks to the whole TMZ. Carbon metabolism in the TMZ and fluxes upstream of the TMZ were compared on the dates of field surveys, and the routes and fate of carbon in the TMZ were quantified in order to learn about the trophic status of this estuarine zone in terms of autotrophy vs. heterotrophy. The upstream total organic carbon (TOC) fluxes (48{\%} of particulate organic carbon (POC), 52{\%} of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on average) varied fourfold between the surveys, reaching the highest value of 280 TC d-1 during the wet summer of 2001; and the lowest value of about 70 TC d-1 in August 2003. Whereas nearly all of the DOC flux entering the TMZ reaches the coastal marine zone, mostly (at least 85{\%}) in a refractory form, the POC accumulates in the TMZ of the estuarine channel, particle exportation being negligible. In the TMZ, biodegradation of DOC was, on average, much less (only a 2{\%} decrease in the BDOC/DOC ratio between the TMZ upstream and downstream fluxes) than biodegradation of POC (11{\%}). A simplified model of the TMZ (LIFT- Lumped Idealisation of the ecological Functioning in estuarine Turbidity maximum) was constructed for investigating the dynamics of organic matter on a seasonal scale. The agreement between observation and calculation allowed us to run sensitivity tests using new constraints; reductions of the upstream fluxes of phytoplankton and organic carbon showed that the high content of organic matter, originating mostly from the domestic effluents of the Paris conurbation, can explain the high organic content of the Seine estuary TMZ. {\copyright}2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Contrasted hydrological conditions were observed (extremely wet in 2001, unusually dry in 2003). Nutrient fluxes were analysed in terms of an indicator of coastal eutrophication potential (ICEP) using nutrient stoichiometry. Besides these three years, nutrient fluxes and corresponding ICEP values were analysed for a 17-year period, from 1990 to 2006.N, P and Si forms did not show ample transformations in the salinity gradient, revealing that the estuary plays a limited buffer role at the interface between river and coastal zone, however not inconsiderable during dry hydrology when longer water and particle residence times are compatible with the biological growth rates. The simplified LIFT model of the TMZ, already used for analysing organic matter transformation, was implemented here to simulate the nutrients' behaviour in the salinity gradient and to quantify nutrient fluxes after their transit in the TMZ. Abatements ranging from 15{\%} to 40{\%} of incoming N and P were calculated, without significant changes for silica. Although P-ICEP values did not show a severe risk for coastal eutrophication for the past few years, contrary to the situation from 1970 to 2000, the high N-ICEP, due to a steady use of fertilisers in agriculture, is a real threat for eutrophication and harmful algal blooms. {\copyright}2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

 abstract = {To investigate bottom sediment denitrification at the scale of the Seine drainage network, a semi-potential denitrification assay was used in which river sediments (and riparian soils) were incubated for a few hours under anaerobic conditions with non limiting nitrate concentrations. This method allowed the nitrous oxide (N2O) concentration in the headspace, as well as the nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium concentrations to be determined during incubation. The rates at which nitrate decreased and N2O increased were then used to assess the potential denitrification activity and associated N2O production in the Seine River Basin. We observed a longitudinal pattern characterized by a significant increase of the potential rate of denitrification from upstream sectors to large downstream rivers (orders 7-8), from approximately 3.3 to 9.1 $μ$g NO3--N g-1 h -1, respectively, while the N2O production rates was the highest both in headwaters and in large order rivers (0.14 and 0.09 N 2O-N g-1 h-1, respectively) and significantly lower in the intermediate sectors (0.01 and 0.03 N2O-N g-1 h-1). Consequently, the ratio N2O production:NO 3 reduction was found to reach 5{\%} in headstreams, whereas it averaged 1.2{\%} in the rest of the drainage network, an intermediate percentage being found for the riparian soils. Finally, the ignition loss of sediments, together with other redundant variables (particulate organic carbon content: g C 100 g-1 dry weight [dw], moisture: g water 100 g-1 dw, sediment size {\textless}50 $μ$m: g material size {\textless}50 $μ$m 100 g-1 dw) were found to control these activities. However, the biodegradability of organic matter must be measured to better understand the factor controlling denitrification and its associated N2O production.

The model reproduced the interannual levels and seasonal trends of the major water quality variables. Although eutrophication has been impressively reduced in the drainage network, a eutrophication risk still exists at the coast, as shown by the N-ICEP indicator, pointing out an excess of nitrogen over silica and phosphorus. From maximum biomass exceeding 120 \textgreek{m}gChla l $-$1 in the 1980's, we observed decreasing maximum values from 80 to 30 \textgreek{m}gChla l $-$1 during the period studied. Several scenarios were explored. Regarding nutrient point sources, a low wastewater treatment scenario, similar to the situation in the 1980's, was elaborated, representing much greater pollution than the reference period (2002--2014). For diffuse sources, two agricultural scenarios were elaborated for reducing nitrogen, one with a strict application of the agricultural directives and another investigating the impact of radical structural changes in agriculture and the population's diet. Although reduced, a risk of eutrophication would remain, even with the most drastic scenario. In addition, a pristine scenario, with no human activity within the basin, was devised to assess water quality in a natural state. The impact of a change in hydrology on the Loire biogeochemical functioning was also explored according to the effect of climate change by the end of the 21st century. The EROS hydrological model was used to force Riverstrahler, considering the most pessimistic SRES A2 scenario run with the ARPEGE model. Nutrient fluxes all decreased due to a {\textgreater}50{\%} reduction in the average annual discharge, overall reducing the risk of coastal eutrophication, but worsening the water quality status of the river network. The Riverstrahler model could be useful to help water managers contend with future threats in the Loire River, at the scale of its basin and at smaller nested scales.}

 abstract = {The Lot river, a major tributary of the downstream Garonne river, the largest river on the Northern side of the Pyrenees Mountains, was intensively studied in the 1970s. A pioneering program called ``Lot Rivi{\`e}re Claire'' provided a diagnosis of water quality at the scale of the whole watershed and proposed an ambitious program to manage nutrient pollution and eutrophication largely caused by urban wastewater releases. Later on, the implementation of European directives from 1991 to 2000 resulted in the nearly complete treatment of point sources of pollution in spite of a doubling of the basin's population. At the outlet of the Lot river, ammonium and phosphate contamination which respectively peaked to 1~mg N-NH4 L$-$1 and 0.3~mg P-PO4 L$-$1 in the 1980s returned to much lower levels in recent years (0.06~mg N-NH4 L$-$1 and 0.02~mg P-PO4 L$-$1), a reduction by a factor 15. However, during this time, nitrate contamination has regularly increased since the 1980s, from 0.5 to 1.2~mg N-NO3 L$-$1 in average, owing to the intensification of agriculture and livestock farming. Application of the Riverstrahler model allowed us to simulate the water quality of the Lot drainage network for the 2002--2014 period. We showed that, with respect to algal requirements, phosphorus and silica are well balanced, but nitrogen remains largely in excess over phosphorus and silica. This imbalance can be problematic for the ecological status of the water bodies. Using the model, for simulating various scenarios of watershed management, we showed that improvement of urban wastewater treatment would not result in any significant change in the river's water quality. Even though arable land occupies a rather limited fraction of the watershed area, only the adoption of better farming practices or more radical changes in the agro-food system could reverse the trend of increasing nitrate contamination.}

 abstract = {The continental coastal waters of the Eastern Channel, from Normandy to Hauts-de-France, are subject to the major influence of unbalanced nutrient inputs from inflowing rivers. Several episodes of harmful algal blooms (HABs) compromising fishing and shellfish farming activities have been observed at the coast. For a better understanding of how the land-to-sea aquatic continuum functions, the GRAFS-RIVERSTRAHLER river biogeochemical model was implemented to cover the watersheds of 11 rivers flowing into this area (including the Seine) and chained with the ecological marine ECO-MARS3D model, applied to the French Northern coastal zone. Human activities strongly impact on the functioning of coastal ecosystems. Specifically, for these fertile soils of Northern France, intensive agricultural nitrogen (N) deliveries in excess over silica (Si) and phosphorus (P), essentially of diffuse origin, are potentially responsible for coastal eutrophication. Phosphorous is today equally supplied by diffuse and point sources, after a drastic reduction of inputs from wastewater treatment plants since the 2000s, and is better balanced regarding Si, as shown by the indicators of coastal eutrophication potential (P-ICEP versus N-ICEP). However, despite this drastic P reduction, HABs still appear repeatedly. Exploration of several scenarios of agro-food chain reorganization shows that (i) further progress in urban wastewater treatment to fully comply with current European regulations will not result in a significant reduction of nutrient fluxes to the sea, hence including HABs, and (ii) radical structural changes in agriculture, based on generalization of long and diversified organic crop rotations, reconnection of crop and livestock farming and changes in the human diet have the capacity to significantly reduce nutrient flows, coastal eutrophication and HABs.}

 abstract = {Bacteria play a central role in the oxidation of organic matter. In tropical estuaries, bacterial metabolic rates and carbon modification are regulated by physicochemical changes influenced by the annual monsoon-mediated river runoff. The present study is the first report on the effect of monsoon-influenced river discharge magnitude on bacterial metabolic rates and organic matter variation in the tropical Godavari estuary and adjacent coastal waters. Concentrations, nature, and sources of particulate organic carbon and nitrogen were investigated by elemental analyser-isotopic ratio mass spectrometer, whereas concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen were determined by a high-temperature catalytic oxidation in surface waters of Godavari estuary, east coast of India. Bacterial abundance and metabolic rates were measured, and pCO2 levels were calculated for surface water samples. The maxima obtained in bacterial respiration (BR) rate (994~\textgreek{m}g C l$-$1 d$-$1) were associated with maximum concentrations and the terrigenous nature of organic matter with high C:N ratio ($\sim$12). The highly depleted \textgreek{d}13C POC ($-$32.9 $\pm$ 1.4‰) associated with Chl-a maxima suggest its contribution from freshwater planktons. The significant positive correlation of bacterial productivity (BP), bacterial growth efficiency (BGE), and BR with particulate organic matter associated with low DOC:POC ratio could imply a heterotrophic preference for an abundant form of organic matter. We, moreover, uncovered that terrigenous organic matter is modified efficiently in the estuarine transect by heterotrophic bacteria under favorable physicochemical conditions like low salinity and high nutrient content. Furthermore, the majority (76{\%}) of BGE values were {\textless}8{\%}, and average pCO2 levels were $\sim$14 times greater than the atmospheric levels. Overall, this study reported that the Godavari estuary is net heterotrophic and hence significantly contributes to global carbon cycle biogeochemistry.}

 abstract = {In order to evaluate the impact of seasonal river discharge on the spatio-temporal variability in the major sources of particulate organic matter (POM) in the tropical Godavari estuary, India, a comprehensive study was conducted for one year from head to mouth of the estuary. Higher concentrations of both particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PN) were observed during the peak discharge period followed by moderate and lean discharge periods associated with magnitude of discharge. POC:Chl-a ratio and isotopic composition of particulate organic carbon ($δ$13C) and nitrogen ($δ$15N) suggest that predominant contribution of OM is from in-situ production during the moderate discharge period associating with higher phytoplankton biomass. Contribution from in-situ sources dominates over terrestrial sources during the lean discharge period also. However, both terrestrial and in-situ sources contributed during the peak discharge period. Discharge mobilised significant amounts of terrestrial OM such as the debris of land plants, agricultural crops, forests and soils in the catchment during peak and moderate discharge periods. Strong stratification during the moderate discharge period enhanced phytoplankton production, mainly by freshwater algae. Dual isotope mixing model analysis revealed that freshwater phytoplankton contributed significantly to the POM pool (20--90{\%}) during the moderate discharge period whereas contribution from terrestrial C3 plants (20--40{\%}) dominated during the peak discharge period. Our study demonstrates that river discharge modifies content and source of OM to the estuary that may have significant impact of heterotrophic activity.}

The atmospheric flow around megacities is complicated by urban heat island effects and topographic flows and sea breezes and influences air pollution and human health. The outflow of polluted air over the ocean perturbs biogeochemical processes. Contaminant inputs can damage downstream coastal zone ecosystem function and resources including fisheries, induce harmful algal blooms and feedback to the atmosphere via marine emissions.

 abstract = {Anthropogenic activities are altering total nutrient loads to many estuaries and freshwaters, resulting in high loads not only of total nitrogen (N), but in some cases, of chemically reduced forms, notably NH4+. Long thought to be the preferred form of N for phytoplankton uptake, NH4+ may actually suppress overall growth when concentrations are sufficiently high. NH4+ has been well known to be inhibitory or repressive for NO3- uptake and assimilation, but the concentrations of NH4+ that promote vs. repress NO3- uptake, assimilation, and growth in different phytoplankton groups and under different growth conditions are not well understood. Here, we review N metabolism first in a {\textquotedbl}generic{\textquotedbl} eukaryotic cell, and the contrasting metabolic pathways and regulation of NH4+ and NO3- when these substrates are provided individually under equivalent growth conditions. Then the metabolic interactions of these substrates are described when both are provided together, emphasizing the cellular challenge of balancing nutrient acquisition with photosynthetic energy balance in dynamic environments. Conditions under which dissipatory pathways such as dissimilatory NO3-/ NO2- reduction to NH4+ and photorespiration that may lead to growth suppression are highlighted. While more is known about diatoms, taxon-specific differences in NH4+ and NO3- metabolism that may contribute to changes in phytoplankton community composition when the composition of the N pool changes are presented. These relationships have important implications for harmful algal blooms, development of nutrient criteria for management, and modeling of nutrient uptake by phytoplankton, particularly in conditions where eutrophication is increasing and the redox state of N loads is changing.}

 abstract = {Climate projections suggest--with substantial certainty--that global warming {\textgreater}1.5 °C will occur by mid-century (2050). Population is also projected to increase, amplifying the demands for food, fuel, water and sanitation, which, in turn, escalate nutrient pollution. Global projections of nutrient pollution, however, are less certain than those of climate as there are regionally decreasing trends projected in Europe, and stabilization of nutrient use in North America and Australia. In this review of the effects of eutrophication and climate on harmful algae, some of the complex, subtle, and non-intuitive effects and interactions on the physiology of both harmful and non-harmful taxa are emphasized. In a future ocean, non-harmful diatoms may be disproportionately stressed and mixotrophs advantaged due to changing nutrient stoichiometry and forms of nutrients, temperature, stratification and oceanic pH. Modeling is advancing, but there is much yet to be understood, in terms of physiology, biogeochemistry and trophodynamics and how both harmful and nonharmful taxa may change in an uncertain future driven by anthropogenic activities.}

Analyses were based on 587 water samples collected between 1990 and 2010 and additionally revealed marked long-term changes in sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS) and turbidity (Secchi depth). The abundances of dinoflagellate genera were positively correlated to SST, particularly during and after the 1997-1998 El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation event. Several diatom genera increased in abundances with decreasing turbidity around and after 1995-2000, mainly the large celled genera Coscinodiscus spp, Odontella spp and Ditylum spp. In 1996-2000, sample genus richness increased from mean of 8-14, and decreased to 11 thereafter. The increase in sample genus richness was linked to the more frequent presence of most taxa during 1996-2000. Increasing Secchi depth and abundance of frequently encountered large-celled diatoms concurrent with decreasing abundances of Trichodesmium spp might signal the alleviation of the nitrogen limitation in the region, favouring diatoms.},

 abstract = {Eutrophication of fresh waters results in increased CO2 uptake by primary production, but at the same time increased emissions of CH4 to the atmosphere. Given the contrasting effects of CO2 uptake and CH4 release, the net effect of eutrophication on the CO2 -equivalent balance of fresh waters is not clear. We measured carbon fluxes (CO2 and CH4 diffusion, CH4 ebullition) and CH4 oxidation in 20 freshwater mesocosms with 10 different nutrient concentrations (total phosphorus range: mesotrophic 39~µg/L until hypereutrophic 939~µg/L) and planktivorous fish in half of them. We found that the CO2 -equivalent balance had a U-shaped relationship with productivity, up to a threshold in hypereutrophic systems. CO2 -equivalent sinks were confined to a narrow range of net ecosystem production (NEP) between 5 and 19~mmol~O2 ~m-3 ~day-1 . Our findings indicate that eutrophication can shift fresh waters from sources to sinks of CO2 -equivalents due to enhanced CO2 uptake, but continued eutrophication enhances CH4 emission and transforms freshwater ecosystems to net sources of CO2 -equivalents to the atmosphere. Nutrient enrichment but also planktivorous fish presence increased productivity, thereby regulating the resulting CO2 -equivalent balance. Increasing planktivorous fish abundance, often concomitant with eutrophication, will consequently likely affect the CO2 -equivalent balance of fresh waters.}

A comprehensive approach was used to assess the impacts and strategies for reducing industrial, municipal and agricultural pollution to the water, air and land. The strategy was based upon use of knowledge in four subject areas, economics, ecology, technology and institutions, integrated within a framework for regional environmental quality management, sometimes called Areawide Environmental Quality Management (AEQM). Dong Nai Province encompasses a major developing area immediately north of Ho Chi Minh City. The land area chosen for the AEQM study is the 1,400 square kilometre region in and around Bien Hoa that drains into the Dong Nai River. The Dong Nai River serves many purposes including navigation, fisheries and a water supply for both the Province and Ho Chi Minh City. Extensive industrial and residential development was underway and was projected to increase in the coming decade. A strategy for the control of pollution from liquid, gaseous and solid wastes for the period 1998 to 2010 in Dong Nai Province was developed.}

 abstract = {Benthic--pelagic coupling is manifested as the exchange of energy, mass, or nutrients between benthic and pelagic habitats. It plays a prominent role in aquatic ecosystems, and it is crucial to functions from nutrient cycling to energy transfer in food webs. Coastal and estuarine ecosystem structure and function are strongly affected by anthropogenic pressures; however, there are large gaps in our understanding of the responses of inorganic nutrient and organic matter fluxes between benthic habitats and the water column. We illustrate the varied nature of physical and biological benthic--pelagic coupling processes and their potential sensitivity to three anthropogenic pressures -- climate change, nutrient loading, and fishing -- using the Baltic Sea as a case study and summarize current knowledge on the exchange of inorganic nutrients and organic material between habitats. Traditionally measured benthic--pelagic coupling processes (e.g., nutrient exchange and sedimentation of organic material) are to some extent quantifiable, but the magnitude and variability of biological processes are rarely assessed, preventing quantitative comparisons. Changing oxygen conditions will continue to have widespread effects on the processes that govern inorganic and organic matter exchange among habitats while climate change and nutrient load reductions may have large effects on organic matter sedimentation. Many biological processes (predation, bioturbation) are expected to be sensitive to anthropogenic drivers, but the outcomes for ecosystem function are largely unknown. We emphasize how improved empirical and experimental understanding of benthic--pelagic coupling processes and their variability are necessary to inform models that can quantify the feedbacks among processes and ecosystem responses to a changing world.}

 abstract = {Along the fluvial to marine transition zone (FMTZ) of river deltas, the river-tidal dynamics exert a primary control on channel width, sinuosity, and bed elevation; however, other local factors, such as valley confinements, bifurcations, and confluences, can modify the channel morphology. Here, we report a case study of the major channel of the Ðồng Nai River System (DNRS) that shows complex morphological trends linked to multiple factors. This study is based on the analysis of satellite images and bathymetric maps of the studied channel, together with a digital elevation model of the area and additional climate and hydrology data. Our study shows that channel width, sinuosity, and bed elevation show mutual relationships and complex upstream to downstream trends linked to the river-tidal dynamics and valley confinements, together with more local effects due to bifurcations and confluences. The tidal dynamics is mainly responsible for the seaward-widening and seaward-shallowing trends and the abrupt decrease in channel sinuosity observed in the downstream tract of the channel, whereas the relatively constant channel width and sinuosity in the upstream tract suggest a control of the river dynamics. The studied channel also shows three areas of valley widening or exit, which are characterized by high channel sinuosity, the presence of minor and major bifurcations, and additional changes in channel width and bed elevation, and they are considered important nodes in this system. Valley-related nodes also show different active and inactive features, implying that the degree of activity and importance of these nodes likely varied through time, migrating from upstream to downstream due to the deltaic progradation.}

Here, we report a case study from the Dong Nai River System (DNRS), a small-scale, tide-dominated river delta from southern Vietnam. The study is based on 80 channel bed sediment samples, together with channel depth, temperature, and salinity measurements, identification of mangroves and mollusks, and grain-size analysis. Year-round meter-scale water-level fluctuations due to tides are present across the entire study area, whereas saline-water intrusion affects the entire studied part of the Vam Co Dong--Vam Co River and the majority of the studied part of the Dong Nai--Soai Rap River. The sediment distribution of both channels highlights the presence of a downstream area characterized by soft mud indicating active deposition, and upstream areas characterized by sand and gravel sediments with abundant bedrock clasts and other evidence of the extremely limited sedimentation (e.g., encrusting biostructures, borings, coating, and agglutinated mats). The coarser-grained sand and gravel are likely reworked from local bedrock and transported for short distances as also suggested by their angularity and the similarities with Pleistocene sedimentary and igneous rocks in the study area. The sediment of the DNRS is overall coarser and muddier than the sediment of the Mekong, likely reflecting the smaller scale of this system, the lower discharge, and the local sediment supply from the bedrock.}

 journal = {Ecosystems},
 abstract = {Carbon biogeochemistry of a tropical ecosystem (The Cochin Estuary, India) undergoing increased human intervention was studied during February (premonsoon), April (early monsoon) and September (monsoon) 2005. The Cochin estuary sustains high levels of pCO2 (up to 6000 $μ$atm) and CO 2 effluxes (up to 274 mmolC m-2 d-1) especially during monsoon. A first-order estimate of the carbon mass balance shows that net production of dissolved inorganic carbon is an order of magnitude higher than the net loss of dissolved and particulate organic carbon from the estuary. This imbalance is attributed to the organic inputs to the estuary through anthropogenic supplies. The bacteria-mediated mineralization of organic matter is mainly responsible for the build-up of pCO2 and increased CO 2 emission to the atmosphere indicating heterotrophy. The linear correlation between excess CO2 and apparent oxygen utilization indicates respiration as the chief mechanism for CO2 supersaturation. An increase in the net negative ecosystem production (-ve NEP) between premonsoon (-136 mmolC m-2 d-1 or -376 MgC d-1) and monsoon (-541 mmolC m-2 d-1 or -1500 MgC d -1) is supported by a corresponding increase in O2 influxes from 17 mmol O2 m-2 d-1 (126 MgC d-1) to -128 mmol O2 m-2 d-1 (-946 MgC d-1) and CO2 emissions from 65 mmolC m-2 d-1 (180 MgC d-1) to 267 mmolC m-2 d -1 (740 MgC d-1). There is a significant north-south gradient in metabolic rates and CO2 fluxes attributable to the varying flow patterns and anthropogenic inputs into the estuary. The study reveals that the Cochin estuary, a previously autotrophic (CO2 sink) system, has been transformed to a heterotrophic (CO2 source) system following rapid urbanization and industrialization. Moreover, the export fluxes from the Cochin estuary appear to be quite important in sustaining net heterotrophy in the southeastern Arabian Sea. {\copyright}2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.}

 abstract = {The freshwater (RIVE) and the marine (MIRO) biogeochemical models were coupled to a 1D hydro-sedimentary model to describe contemporary phytoplankton succession and nutrient transfers in the macrotidal Scheldt estuary (BE/NL) affected by anthropogenic nutrient loads. The 1D-RIVE-MIRO model simulations are performed between Ghent and Vlissingen and the longitudinal estuarine profiles are validated by visual and statistical comparison with physico-chemical and phytoplankton observations available for the year 2006. Results show the occurrence of two distinct spatial phytoplankton blooms in the upper and lower estuary, suggesting that neither the freshwater nor the marine phytoplankton gets over the maximum turbidity zone (MTZ) at the saline transition. Sensitivity tests performed to understand how changing conditions (salinity, turbidity and nutrients) along the estuary are controlling this bimodal spatial phytoplankton distribution identify salinity and light availability as the key drivers while the grazing pressure and nutrient limitation play a negligible role. Additional tests with varying salinity-resistant (euryhaline) species in the freshwater assemblage conclude that the presence (or absence) of euryhalines determines the magnitude and the spreading of freshwater and marine phytoplankton blooms in the estuary. Annual nutrient budgets estimated from 1D-RIVE-MIRO simulations show that biological activities have a negligible impact on nutrient export but modify the speciation of nutrients exported to the coastal zone towards inorganic forms, thus directly available to phytoplankton. The implementation of nutrient reduction options (upgrading of waste water treatment plants, conversion to organic farming) on the Scheldt watershed influences the whole estuary and affects both the magnitude and the speciation of nutrients exported to the coastal zone with expected impact on coastal phytoplankton dynamic. {\copyright}2012 Elsevier B.V.},

In terms of suspended sediment delivery to the sea, the Tien River accounted for a more variable portion of 55{\%} in neutral years, 57.3{\%} in 2015-2016 (El Ni{\~n}o) and 62{\%} in 2011 (La Ni{\~n}a). 80{\%} of water discharge occurred during the flood season (July-December) and 20{\%} occurred in the low flow season (January-June), the proportion being 91{\%} and 9{\%} for the sediment supply. Previous estimates of annual sediment supplies to the sea (145-160 Mt yr-1) had been established before 2003. Possible origins of the recent reduction by {\~{}}75{\%} of sediment supply are presented and discussed.}

 abstract = {Southern Vietnam is known as one of the most vulnerable areas to climate change in the world due to its low elevation and flat topography, heavy groundwater use, and dense population. This paper introduces hydrogeological conditions and critically reviews groundwater issues that southern Vietnam faces by summarizing previous literatures. Issues that this paper covers include groundwater use and associated phenomenon, acid sulfate soils, the occurrence of saline groundwaters, seawater intrusion, land subsidence, groundwater acidification, and groundwater contamination by nitrate, ammonium, and trace metals such as As, Fe, Mn, Al, Cd, and Pb. This paper shows that most of these issues are inter-related and essentially linked with the unique hydrogeological setting of the study area. However, many of these problems have also been triggered or aggravated by human activities that use water resources and land. Issues such as those of As contamination and groundwater acidification are connected with the aquifer characteristics that are generally confined and rich in organics and pyrite. However, groundwater salinization, acidification, groundwater level declining, land subsidence, and high heavy metal concentrations are in large part caused by human activities such as well installation and heavy groundwater abstraction. While previous studies have proposed artificial recharge as a promising means of mitigating groundwater issues in the study area, the development of techniques that help minimizing aquifer disturbances is also likely required.}

The intense aerobic respiration there contributed to high-concentration NH4+, and meanwhile caused a pH decrease of 0.042units and a pCO2 increase of 166\textgreek{m}atm per day. Moreover, the linear relationship between excess CO2 and apparent oxygen utilization suggested that the excess CO2 in the entire eastern Jiaozhou Bay was mainly from the aerobic respiration. This study may help us better understand the role of aerobic respiration in DIN composition and CO2 sink/source pattern in coastal waters.}

These bacteria are classified into three groups based on the pathways used for assimilation of formaldehyde, the major source of cell carbon, and other physiological and morphological features. The type I and type X methanotrophs are found within the gamma subdivision of the Proteobacteria and employ the ribulose monophosphate pathway for formaldehyde assimilation, whereas type II methanotrophs, which employ the serine pathway for formaldehyde assimilation, form a coherent cluster within the beta subdivision of the Proteobacteria. Methanotrophic bacteria are ubiquitous. The growth of type II bacteria appears to be favored in environments that contain relatively high levels of methane, low levels of dissolved oxygen, and limiting concentrations of combined nitrogen and/or copper. Type I methanotrophs appear to be dominant in environments in which methane is limiting and combined nitrogen and copper levels are relatively high. These bacteria serve as biofilters for the oxidation of methane produced in anaerobic environments, and when oxygen is present in soils, atmospheric methane is oxidized. Their activities in nature are greatly influenced by agricultural practices and other human activities. Recent evidence indicates that naturally occurring, uncultured methanotrophs represent new genera. Methanotrophs that are capable of oxidizing methane at atmospheric levels exhibit methane oxidation kinetics different from those of methanotrophs available in pure cultures. A limited number of methanotrophs have the genetic capacity to synthesize a soluble methane monooxygenase which catalyzes the rapid oxidation of environmental pollutants including trichloroethylene.}

 abstract = {Assessing the sources and quantifying the contributions of particulate organic matter (POM) in estuaries is a challenge. Here we apply source-specific biomarkers to assess POM sources in an estuary receiving suspended material from freshwater wetlands, fringe mangroves and coastal environments. A three end-member mixing model, including terrestrial, estuarine and marine end-member contributions was developed and successfully validated to assess general OM dynamics and hydrologic processes that control POM distributions within the Shark River estuary in South Florida. Low tide and wet season conditions coincided with an enhanced signal of the freshwater end-member biomarker abundance, while high tide and dry season conditions resulted in enhanced POM input of marine origin. Incoming tide was observed to be an important factor in the re-suspension and tidal pumping of mangrove-derived POM, which seems to be the dominant source of particulate organic carbon (POC) in the estuary. The three end-member conceptual model was tested to obtain a rough estimate of POC source strength, with the ultimate goal of constraining carbon budgets in this sub-tropical estuary. Mangrove-derived POC flux of ca. 5.3$\times$105 to 1.0$\times$106kg/yr POC from the Shark River to the Gulf of Mexico were estimated, but end-member values used in the assessment need to be better constrained to reduce the degree of variability. {\copyright}2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

 abstract = {We investigated the seasonal and geographical variation in the stable carbon isotope ratios of total dissolved inorganic carbon ($δ$13C(D1C)) and suspended matter ($δ$13C(POC)) in the freshwater part of the River Scheldt. Two major sources of particulate organic matter (PAM) occur in this riverine system: riverine phytoplankton and terrestrial detritus. In winter the lowest $δ$13C(DIC) values are observed due to enhanced input of CO2 from decomposition of 13C-depleted terrestrial plant detritus (average $δ$13C(DIC) = -14.3‰). During summer, when litter input from terrestrial flora is the lowest, water column respiration on POM of terrestrial origin is also the lowest as evidenced by less negative $δ$13C(DIC) values (average $δ$13(CDIC) = -9.9‰). In winter the phytoplankton biomass is low, as indicated by low chlorophyll a concentrations (Chl a {\textless}4.5 $μ$gl-1), compared to summer when chlorophyll a concentrations can rise to a maximum of 54 $μ$gl-1. Furthermore, in winter the very narrow range of $δ$13C(POC) (from -26.5 to -27.6‰) is associated with relatively high C/N ratios (C/N {\textgreater}9) suggesting that in winter a major fraction of POC is derived from allochthonous matter. In summer $δ$13C(POC) exhibits a very wide range of values, with the most negative values coinciding with high Chl a concentrations and low C/N ratios (C/N {\textless}8). This suggests predominance of phytoplankton carbon in the total particulate carbon pool, utilising a dissolved inorganic carbon reservoir, which is already significantly depleted in 13C. Using a simple two source mixing approach a reconstruction of the relative importance of phytoplankton to the total POC pool and of 13C/12C fractionation by phytoplankton is attempted.}

The study demonstrated that the Day River was eutrophic with the average values of total phosphorus concentration 0.17~mg/L, total nitrogen concentration 1.98~mg/L, and Chl a 54~$μ$g/L. Microscopic plankton analysis showed that phytoplankton comprised 87 species belonging to seven groups in which Chlorophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, and Cyanobacteria accounted for the most important constituents of the river's phytoplankton assemblage. A total 53 zooplankton species belonging to three main groups including Copepoda, Cladocera, and Rotatoria were identified. Plankton biomass values were greatest in rainy season (3002.10-3 cell/L for phytoplankton and 12.573 individuals/m3 for zooplankton). Using principal correspondence and Pearson correlation analyses, it was found that the Day River was divided into three main site groups based on water quality and characteristics of plankton community. Temperature and nutrients (total phosphorus and total nitrogen) are key factors regulating plankton abundance and distribution in the Day River.}

 abstract = {A 1-D, pelagic, reactive-transport model of a completely mixed, turbid, heterotrophic estuary - the Scheldt estuary - is presented. The model resolves major carbon and nitrogen species and oxygen, as well as pH. The model features two organic matter degradation pathways, oxic mineralisation and denitrification, and includes primary production as well as nitrification. Apart from advective-dispersive transport along the length axis, the model also describes O2, CO2, and N2 air-water exchange. The aim of this study is to present a model which is as simple as possible but still fits the data well enough to determine the fate and turnover of nutrients entering the estuary and their spatial patterns in the years 2000 to 2004. Nitrification is identified as one of the most important processes in the estuary, consuming a comparable amount of oxygen as oxic mineralisation (1.7 Gmol O2 yminus;1 vs. 2.7 Gmol O2 y minus;1). About 10{\%} of the 2.5 Gmol of nitrogen entering the estuary per year is lost within the estuary due to denitrification. Nitrogen and carbon budgets are compared to budgets from the seventies and eighties, showing that nitrification activity has peaked in the eighties, while denitrification steadily declined. Our model estimates an average CO2 emission of 3.3 Gmol yminus;1 in the years 2001 to 2004, which is a comparatively low estimate in the context of previous estimates of CO2 export from the Scheldt estuary.}

 journal = {Estuaries},
 abstract = {Benthic metabolism and nutrient exchange across the sediment-water interface were examined over an annual cycle at four sites along a freshwater to marine transect in the Parker River-Plum Island Sound estuary in northeastern Massachusetts, U.S. Sediment organic carbon content was highest at the freshwater site (10.3{\%}) and decreased along the salinity gradient to 0.2{\%} in the sandy sediments at the marine end of the estuary. C:N ratios were highest in the mid estuary (23:1) and lowest near the sea (11:1). Chlorophyll a in the surface sediments was high along the entire length of the estuary (39-57 mg chlorophyll a m-2) but especially so in the sandy marine sediments (172 mg chlorophyll a m-2). Chlorophyll a to phaeophytin ratios suggested most chlorophyll is detrital, except at the sandy marine site. Porewater sulfide values varied seasonally and between sites, reflecting both changes in sulfate availability as overlying water salinity changed and sediment metabolism. Patterns of sediment redox potential followed those of sulfide. Porewater profiles of inorganic N and P reflected strong seasonal patterns in remineralization, accumulation, and release. Highest porewater NH4+ values were found in upper and mid estuarine sediments, occasionally exceeding 1 mM N. Porewater nitrate was frequently absent, except in the sandy marine sediments where concentrations of 8 $μ$M were often observed. Annual average respiration was lowest at the marine site (13 mmol O2 m-2 d-1 and 21 mmol TCO2 m-2 d-1) and highest in the mid estuary (130 mmol O2 m-2 d-1 and 170 mmol TCO2 m-2 d-1) where clam densities were also high. N2O and CH4 fluxes were low at all stations throughout the year. Over the course of a year, sediments varied from being sources to sinks of dissolved organic C and N, with the overall spatial pattern related closely to sediment organic content. There was little correlation between PO43- flux and metabolism, which we attribute to geochemical processes. At the two sites having the lowest salinities, PO43- flux was directed into the sediments. On average, between 22{\%} and 32{\%} of total system metabolism was attributable to the benthos. The mid estuary site was an exception as benthic metabolism accounted for 95{\%} of the total, which is attributable to high densities of filter-feeding clams. Benthic remineralization supplied from less than 1{\%} to over 190{\%} of the N requirements and 0{\%} to 21{\%} of the P requirements of primary producers in this system. Estimates of denitrification calculated from stoichiometry of C and N fluxes ranged from 0{\%} for the upper and mid estuary site to 35{\%} for the freshwater site to 100{\%} of sediment organic N remineralization at the marine site. We hypothesize that low values in the upper and mid estuary are attributable to enhanced NH4+ fluxes during summer due to desorption of exchangeable ammonium from rising porewater salinity. NH4+ desorption during summer may be a mechanism that maintains high rates of pelagic primary production at a time of low inorganic N inputs from the watershed.}

The adsorption coefficient of ammonium in the study area ranged from 3.81 to 9.00, and had a significant positive correlation with total organic carbon (r = 0.779, $α$= 0.02284 , n=8), reflecting that organic matter might be one of the main factors controlling the behavior of ammonium adsorption. It also showed that salinity had a pronounced effect on ammonium adsorption, and that salinity affected the distribution of ammonium between the sediments and waters. The amount of ammonium adsorption on sediments gradually decreased with the increasing salinity. Especially within the range of lower salinity, just a little change of salinity had a dramatic influence on ammonium adsorption by sediments.}

 journal = {Limnol. Oceanogr.},
 abstract = {The first special volume of Limnology and Oceanography, published in 1972, focused on whether phosphorus (P) or carbon (C) is the major agent causing eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems. Only slight mention was made that estuaries may behave differently from lakes and that nitrogen (N) may cause eutrophication in estuaries. In the following decade, an understanding of eutrophication in estuaries proceeded in relative isolation from the community of scientists studying lakes. National water quality policy in the United States was directed almost solely toward P control for both lakes and estuaries, and similarly, European nations tended to focus on P control in lakes. Although bioassay data indicated N control of eutrophication in estuaries as early as the 1970s, this body of knowledge was treated with skepticism by many freshwater scientists and water-quality managers, because bioassay data in lakes often did not properly indicate the importance of P relative to C in those ecosystems. Hence, the bioassay data in estuaries had little influence on water-quality management. Over the past two decades, a strong consensus has evolved among the scientific community that N is the primary cause of eutrophication in many coastal ecosystems. The development of this consensus was based in part on data from whole-ecosystem studies and on a growing body of evidence that presented convincing mechanistic reasons why the controls of eutrophication in lakes and coastal marine ecosystems may differ. Even though N is probably the major cause of eutrophication in most coastal systems in the temperate zone, optimal management of coastal eutrophication suggests controlling both N and P, in part because P can limit primary production in some systems. In addition, excess P in estuaries can interact with the availability of N and silica (Si) to adversely affect ecological structure. Reduction of P to upstream freshwater ecosystems can also benefit coastal marine ecosystems through mechanisms such as increased Si fluxes. {\copyright}2006, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.}

 abstract = {Nutrient fluxes to coastal areas have risen in recent decades, leading to widespread hypoxia and other ecological damage, particularly from nitrogen (N). Several factors make N more limiting in estuaries and coastal waters than in lakes: desorption (release) of phosphorus (P) bound to clay as salinity increases, lack of planktonic N fixation in most coastal ecosystems, and flux of relatively P-rich, N-poor waters from coastal oceans into estuaries. During eutrophication, biogeochemical feedbacks further increase the supply of N and P, but decrease availability of silica - conditions that can favor the formation and persistence of harmful algal blooms. Given sufficient N inputs, estuaries and coastal marine ecosystems can be driven to P limitation. This switch contributes to greater far-field N pollution; that is, the N moves further and contributes to eutrophication at greater distances. The physical oceanography (extent of stratification, residence time, and so forth) of coastal systems determines their sensitivity to hypoxia, and recent changes in physics have made some ecosystems more sensitive to hypoxia. Coastal hypoxia contributes to ocean acidification, which harms calcifying organisms such as mollusks and some crustaceans. {\copyright}The Ecological Society of America.}

 abstract = {Over recent years, accelerated anthropogenic nutrient discharges have exerted great pressure on the water quality management in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China. There is a concern about the eutrophication processes and hypoxia in this region. A better understanding of the origins and transport of nutrients is required before accurate prediction of impacts of nutrients on eutrophication and hypoxia in the PRD can be anticipated. Therefore a coupled physical-biological model is developed to simulate the fluxes and transformations of nutrients in the PRD. The coupled model combines a one-dimensional model for the river network (called the RNPRD) and a three-dimensional model for the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), which are both physical-biological models. The model is calibrated and validated to different sets of field data. The model results of water surface elevation, discharges, salinity, suspended sediment and water quality variables are in reasonable agreement with the observational data, suggesting that the model is robust enough to capture the physical and biogeochemical dynamics in the PRD. Also, the fluxes and transformations of carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD), ammonia nitrogen (NH3), nitrate plus nitrite nitrogen (NO23) and inorganic phosphorus (IP) in July 1999 (wet season) are explored and discussed. Results show that the RNPRD act as a source for NO23, but a sink for CBOD, NH3 and IP that consumes 50{\%}, 37{\%} and 11{\%} of their external loads, respectively. The riverine fluxes of nutrients exported from the RNPRD to the PRE are generally controlled by high river discharge and significantly contributed by upstream inputs. The riverine fluxes are the largest inputs of nutrients to the PRE. The PRE also behaves as a source for NO23, but a sink for CBOD, NH3 and IP that consumes 90{\%}, 80{\%} and 16{\%} of their external loads, respectively. The estuarine fluxes of nutrients exported from the PRE to the South China Sea are significantly contributed by the external and internal sources of nutrients in the PRE. In the RNPRD, the transformations of CBOD, NH3 (also NO23) and IP are dominated by carbonaceous oxidation, nitrification and deposition, respectively. Regarding the PRE, carbonaceous oxidation, nitrification and phytoplankton uptake are identified as the dominant processes with respect to CBOD, NH3 (also NO23) and IP. Unlike the RNPRD, the phytoplankton dynamics and internal sources of nutrients play an important role in the nutrient budgets in the PRE. Also, seasonal variations of the nutrient budgets in the PRD are discussed. Model results indicate that the dry season and wet season have a similar feature in terms of transformations of nutrients, but show significant seasonal variations in terms of nutrient fluxes. At the same time, the PRE is compared to the Changjiang and Mississippi Rivers with regard to differences in nutrient inputs between these similar river-dominated systems. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We conducted a meta-analysis incorporating 169 observations from published literature to estimate global riverine N2O emission rates and emission factors. Riverine N2O flux was significantly correlated with NH4, NO3 and DIN (NH4~+~NO3) concentrations, loads and yields. The emission factors EF(a) (i.e., the ratio of N2O emission rate and DIN load) and EF(b) (i.e., the ratio of N2O and DIN concentrations) values were comparable and showed negative correlations with nitrogen concentration, load and yield and water discharge, but positive correlations with the dissolved organic carbon~:~DIN ratio. After individually evaluating 82 potential regression models based on EF(a) or EF(b) for global, temperate zone and subtropical zone datasets, a power function of DIN yield multiplied by watershed area was determined to provide the best fit between modeled and observed riverine N2O emission rates (EF(a): R2~=~0.92 for both global and climatic zone models, n~=~70; EF(b): R2~=~0.91 for global model and R2~=~0.90 for climatic zone models, n~=~70). Using recent estimates of DIN loads for 6400 rivers, models estimated global riverine N2O emission rates of 29.6--35.3 (mean~=~32.2) Gg N2O--N~yr$-$1 and emission factors of 0.16--0.19{\%} (mean~=~0.17{\%}). Global riverine N2O emission rates are forecasted to increase by 35{\%}, 25{\%}, 18{\%} and 3{\%} in 2050 compared to the 2000s under the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment's Global Orchestration, Order from Strength, Technogarden, and Adapting Mosaic scenarios, respectively. Previous studies may overestimate global riverine N2O emission rates (300--2100 Gg N2O--N~yr$-$1) because they ignore declining emission factor values with increasing nitrogen levels and channel size, as well as neglect differences in emission factors corresponding to different nitrogen forms. Riverine N2O emission estimates will be further enhanced through refining emission factor estimates, extending measurements longitudinally along entire river networks and improving estimates of global riverine nitrogen loads.}

The influence of environmental variables on greenhouse gases (GHGs) concentration under the disturbance of anthropogenic activities was discussed by Spearman correlative analysis and multiple stepwise regression analysis.

The GHGs concentration and saturation were higher in comprehensively polluted river sites and lower in lightly polluted river sites. The three GHGs emission fluxes in two sewage draining rivers of Tianjin were clearly higher than those of other rivers (natural rivers) and the spatial variation of CH4 was more obvious than the others. CO2 and N2O air-water interface emission fluxes of the sewage draining rivers in four seasons were about 1.20-2.41 times and 1.13-3.12 times of those in the natural rivers. The CH4 emission fluxes of the sewage draining rivers were 3.09 times in fall to 10.87 times in spring of those in the natural rivers in different season. The wind speed, water temperature and air temperature were related to GHGs concentrations. Nitrate and nitrite (NO3-+NO2--N) and ammonia (NH4+-N) were positively correlated with CO2 concentration and CH4 concentration; and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration was negatively correlated with CH4 concentration and N2O concentration. The effect of human activities on carbon and nitrogen cycling in river is great.}

Affected by both reservoir operation and seasonal changes, variations in the hydro-morphological conditions in the river-reservoir continuum will create distinctive patterns in water surface GHG emissions. A one-year field survey was carried out in the Pengxi River-reservoir continuum, a part of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) immediately after the TGR reached its maximum water level. The annual average water surface CO2 and CH4 emissions at the riverine background sampling sites were 6.23~$\pm$~0.93 and 0.025~$\pm$~0.006~mmol~h-1~m-2, respectively. The CO2 emissions were higher than those in the downstream reservoirs. The development of phytoplankton controlled the downstream decrease in water surface CO2 emissions. The presence of thermal stratification in the permanent backwater area supported extensive phytoplankton blooms, resulting in a carbon sink during several months of the year. The CH4 emissions were mainly impacted by water temperature and dissolved organic carbon. The greatest water surface CH4 emission was detected in the fluctuating backwater area, likely due to a shallower water column and abundant organic matter. The Pengxi River backwater area did not show significant increase in water surface GHG emissions reported in tropical reservoirs. In evaluating the net GHG emissions by the impoundment of TGR, the net change in the carbon budget and the contribution of nitrogen and phosphorus should be taken into consideration in this eutrophic river-reservoir continuum.}

 journal = {Environ. Geochem. Health},
 abstract = {This paper reports the fluvial fluxes and estuarine transport of organic carbon and nutrients from a tropical river (Tsengwen River), southwestern Taiwan. Riverine fluxes of organic carbon and nutrients were highly variable temporally, due primarily to temporal variations in river discharge and suspended load. The sediment yield of the drainage basin during the study period (1995-1996, 616 tonne km-2 year-1) was ca. 15 times lower than that of the long-term (1960-1998) average (9379 tonne km2 year-1), resulting mainly from the damming effect and historically low record of river water discharge (5.02 m3 s-1) in 1995. The flushing time of river water in the estuary varied from 5 months in the dry season to {\textgreater}4.5 days in the wet season and about 1 day in the flood period. Consequently, distributions of nutrients, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) were of highly seasonal variability in the estuary. Nutrients and POC behaved nonconservatively but DOC behaved conservatively in the estuary. DOC fluxes were generally greater than POC fluxes with the exception that POC fluxes considerably exceeded DOC fluxes during the flood period. Degradation of DOC and POC within the span of flushing time was insignificant and may contribute little amount of CO2 to the estuary during the wet season and flood period. Net estuarine fluxes of nutrients were determined by riverine fluxes and estuarine removals (or additions) of nutrients. The magnitude of estuarine removal or addition for a nutrient was also seasonally variable, and these processes must be considered for net flux estimates from the river to the sea. As a result, nonconservative fluxes of dissolved inorganic phosphorus ($Δ$DIP) from the estuary are -0.002, -0.09 and -0.59 mmol m-2 day-1, respectively, for dry season, wet season and flood period, indicating internal sinks of DIP during all seasons. Due to high turbidity and short flushing time of estuarine water, $Δ$DIP in the flood period may be derived largely from geochemical processes rather than biological removal, and this $Δ$DIP should not be included in an annual estimate of carbon budget. The internal sink of phosphorus corresponds to a net organic carbon production (photosynthesis-respiration, p-r) during dry (0.21 mmol m-2 day-1) and wet (9.5 mmol m-2 day-1) seasons. The magnitude of net production (p-r) is 1.5 mol m-2 year-1, indicating that the estuary is autotrophic in 1995. However, there is a net nitrogen loss (nitrogen fixation-denitrification {\textless}0) in 1995, but the magnitude is small (-0.17 mol m-2 year-1). {\copyright}2005 Springer.}

 abstract = {A coupled three-dimensional physical-biogeochemical model was developed in order to simulate the ecological functioning of the R{\'i}o de la Plata estuary and plume. The biogeochemical model reproduces the nitrogen cycle between five compartments: dissolved inorganic nitrogen, phytoplankton, zooplankton, detritus and dissolved organic nitrogen. The coupling is tested in seasonal climatological configurations and for the particular year 1999. The circulation is forced with Paran{\'a} and Uruguay rivers discharges, NCEP wind and tide. The biogeochemical model includes loads of inorganic and organic nitrogen from both rivers. The model reproduces the correct tidal amplitudes in the estuary, as well as the most outstanding features of the observed horizontal and vertical structures of the salinity plume. Simulated surface chlorophyll a concentrations exhibit maximum values all year long seaward of the turbidity front, between the 0.5 and 15 isohalines, in agreement with SeaWiFS images of the area. The model simulates well the low primary production in the light-limited highly turbid tidal river (20gC/m2/yr), the high production area in the frontal zone where it can reach 500gC/m2/yr, and the nutrient-limited production in the outer estuary and inner shelf (300gC/m2/yr), with realistic values in each case. According to the 1999 model simulation, the tidal river is the location of organic nitrogen remineralization with a consequent increase of the inorganic pool. At the entrance of the frontal zone, inorganic nitrogen represents about 75{\%} of the whole nitrogen pool, it is reduced to 50{\%} at its sea end-member. The outer estuary has the same sink role for inorganic nitrogen, suggesting that organic nitrogen is the major form exported to the shelf. {\copyright}2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

 journal = {Science of the Total Environment},
 abstract = {The lower Ebro River (Catalonia, Spain) has recently undergone a regime shift from a phytoplankton-dominated to a macrophyte-dominated system. This shift is well known in shallow lakes but apparently it has never been documented in rivers. Two initial hypotheses to explain the collapse of the phytoplankton were considered: a) the diminution of nutrients (bottom-up); b) the filtering effect due to the colonization of the zebra mussel (top-down). Data on water quality, hydrology and biological communities (phytoplankton, macrophytes and zebra mussel) was obtained both from existing data sets and new surveys. Results clearly indicate that the decrease in phosphorus is the main cause of a dramatic decrease in chlorophyll and large increase in water transparency, triggering the subsequent colonization of macrophytes in the river bed. A Generalized Linear Model analysis showed that the decrease in dissolved phosphorus had a relative importance 14 times higher than the increase in zebra mussel density to explain the variation of total chlorophyll. We suggest that the described changes in the lower Ebro River can be considered a novel ecosystem shift. This shift is triggering remarkable changes in the biological communities beyond the decrease of phytoplankton and the proliferation of macrophytes, such as massive colonization of Simulidae (black fly) and other changes in the benthic invertebrate communities that are currently investigated. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Highest nitrapyrin-sensitive rates of bicarbonate assimilation were found in the deep layer at stations located in the inner estuary during summer and autumn, coinciding with dissolved oxygen concentrations generally lower than 1 mg O2 l-1. Possible explanations for this spatial distribution pattern are discussed. Axial and depth distribution of ammonia, nitrite and nitrate suggests that in the deep layer of the inner zone of the estuary nitrification and nitrate and nitrite reduction are occurring concurrently. Nitrification showed a significant positive correlation with temperature, but this correlation was not very strong. It is argued that the wash out of nitrifying bacteria by rainfalls also plays a role in the seasonal variation of nitrification rates.}

North of 18°N, |K1| and |M2| are both growing at 2.2{\%} century-1. The mean increase in total tidal amplitude (0.59 rninyr-1) is less than the present GSL rise (1.7 mmyr-1). However, mean sea level is nearly constant in the NE Pacific, so tidal evolution plays a major regional role in changes in high water levels. The spatial pattem of tidal evolution suggests the influence of large-scale processes, and the similarity in spatial pattems for |K1| and |M2| excludes mechanisms with strong frequency dependence. Increasing tidal amplitudes may impact ocean mixing, nutrient supply, primary production, fisheries, and coastal erosion. {\copyright}2009 by the American Geophysical Union.}

We present nutrient budgets for the Wash system now and create estimates of these budgets 3000 years ago. These show that currently the system is a small sink for fluvial nitrate ({\~{}}30{\%} removal) largely due to denitrification and dissolved inorganic phosphorus ({\~{}}24{\%}) by burial. 3000 years ago, prior to large scale human intervention to reclaim wetlands for agriculture, the Wash system was much bigger and operated as a sink for all terrestrial nitrogen (albeit with much lower inputs) and also a sink for nitrate from the North Sea, predominantly via organic nitrogen burial. A similar change with time is evident in the phosphorus flux. We suggest that this change in function of this estuarine system has been replicated in many other estuarine systems. Given the key role of benthic processes of burial and denitrification we go on to suggest that the classification of estuaries in terms of area and river flow may offer a route to a typology of estuarine nutrient retention efficiency.},

 abstract = {Estuaries with poor flushing and longer residence time retain effluents and pollutants, ultimately resulting in eutrophication, a decline in biodiversity and, finally, deterioration of water quality. Cochin Estuary (CE), southwest coast of India, is under the threat of nutrient enrichment by the anthropogenic interventions and terrestrial inputs through land runoff. The present study used the FVCOM hydrodynamic model coupled with the Lagrangian particle module (passive) to estimate the residence time and to delineate site-specific transport pathways in the CE. The back and forth movements and residence time of particles was elucidated by using metrics such as path length, net displacement and tortuosity. Spatio-temporal patterns of the particle distribution in the CE showed a similar trend during monsoon and post-monsoon with an average residence time of 25 and 30 days, respectively. During the low river discharge period (pre-monsoon), flood-ebb velocities resulted in a minimum net transport of the water and longer residence time of 90 days compared to that of the high discharge period (monsoon). During the pre-monsoon, particle released at the southern upstream (station 15) traversed a path length of 350 km in 90 days before being flushed out through the Fortkochi inlet, where the axial distance was only 35 km. This indicates that the retention capacity of pollutants within the system is very high and can adversely affect the water quality of the ecosystem. However, path length (120 km) and residence time (7.5 days) of CE were considerably reduced during the high discharge period. Thus the reduced path length and the lower residence time can effectively transport the pollutants reaching the system, which will ultimately restore the healthy ecosystem. This is a pioneer attempt to estimate the flushing characteristics and residence time of the CE by integrating the hydrodynamics and Lagrangian particle tracking module of FVCOM. This information is vital for the sustainable management of sensitive ecosystems.}

 abstract = {The main goal of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) is to achieve good ecological status across European surface waters by 2015 and as such, it offers the opportunity and thus the challenge to improve the protection of our coastal systems. It is the main example for Europe's increasing desire to conserve aquatic ecosystems. Ironically, since c. 1975 the increasing adoption of EU directives has been accompanied by a decreasing interest of, for example, the Dutch government to assess the quality of its coastal and marine ecosystems. The surveillance and monitoring started in NL in 1971 has declined since the 1980s resulting in a 35{\%} reduction of sampling stations. Given this and interruptions the remaining data series is considered to be insufficient for purposes other than trend analysis and compliance. The Dutch marine managers have apparently chosen a minimal (cost-effective) approach despite the WFD implicitly requiring the incorporation of the system's 'ecological complexity' in indices used to evaluate the ecological status of highly variable systems such as transitional and coastal waters. These indices should include both the community structure and system functioning and to make this really cost-effective a new monitoring strategy is required with a tailor-made programme. Since the adoption of the WFD in 2000 and the launching of the European Marine Strategy in 2002 (and the recently proposed Marine Framework Directive) we suggest reviewing national monitoring programmes in order to integrate water quality monitoring and biological monitoring and change from 'station oriented monitoring' to 'basin or system oriented monitoring' in combination with specific 'cause-effect' studies for highly dynamic coastal systems. Progress will be made if the collected information is integrated and aggregated in valuable tools such as structure- and functioning-oriented computer simulation models and Decision Support Systems. The development of ecological indices integrating community structure and system functioning, such as in Ecological Network Analysis, are proposed to meet a cost-effective approach at the national level and full assessment of the ecosystem status at the EU level. The WFD offers the opportunity to re-consider and re-invest in environmental research and monitoring. Using examples from the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom, the present paper therefore reviews marine monitoring and marine environmental research in combination and in the light of such major policy initiatives such as the WFD.}

The dynamic equilibrium between the overlying water and sediment tended to balance out over time, and the concentration gradient reduced, when the nutrient loading was changed. The greatest variation was observed in the level of iron/aluminum-bound phosphorus, while the calcium-bound phosphorus and organic phosphorus contents showed relatively minor changes.

While dredging and reclamation shaped geochemical features, river discharge with low-turbidity water and sewage treatment plants contributed to nutrient loading. The replete levels of nutrients and short water-residence time suggest the inapplicability of the washout theory, whereas the presence of NH4+ suppressed the growth of phytoplankton. A reduction in the river discharge caused a concomitant decline in the loading and dilution of suspended particles. All these features led to an increase in SPM, light limitation, and NH4+ concentration. GLM estimates revealed negative effects of NH4+ and SPM on chlorophyll a over 9~years while SEM verified synergistic effects of NH4+ and SPM compared with positive effects of NO2~+~NO3-. Our findings provide new insights into phytoplankton bloom dynamics in Gwangyang Bay.}

We also investigated changes in nitrate-N export during the same time period in 8 intensively monitored small watersheds across an urbanization gradient in Baltimore, Maryland. Nitrate-N concentrations in Maryland were greatest in agricultural streams, urban streams, and forest streams respectively. During the period of record drought and wet years, nitrate-N exports in Baltimore showed substantial variation in 6 suburban/urban streams (2.9-15.3 kg/ha/y), 1 agricultural stream (3.4-38.9 kg/ha/y), and 1 forest stream (0.03-0.2 kg/ha/y). Interannual variability was similar for small Baltimore streams and nearby well-monitored tributaries and coincided with record hypoxia in Chesapeake Bay. Discharge-weighted mean annual nitrate concentrations showed a variable tendency to decrease/increase with changes in annual runoff, although total N export generally increased with annual runoff. N retention in small Baltimore watersheds during the 2002 drought was 85{\%}, 99{\%}, and 94{\%} for suburban, forest, and agricultural watersheds, respectively, and declined to 35{\%}, 91{\%}, and 41{\%} during the wet year of 2003. Our results suggest that urban land use change can increase the vulnerability of ecosystem nitrogen retention functions to climatic variability. Further work is necessary to characterize patterns of nitrate-N export and retention in small urbanizing watersheds under varying climatic conditions to improve future forecasting and watershed scale restoration efforts aimed at improving nitrate-N retention.}

 abstract = {We examined how freshwater flow and phytoplankton biomass affected abundance and population dynamics of the introduced subtropical copepod Pseudodiaptomus forbesi in brackish and freshwater regions of the San Francisco Estuary, California, USA. This copepod is key prey for the endangered and food-limited delta smelt, Hypomesus transpacificus, in low-salinity water during summer--autumn. Long-term monitoring data showed that P. forbesi was most abundant in fresh water, where summer--autumn abundance was invariant with freshwater flow. Abundance was positively related to freshwater flow in low-salinity water. Reproductive rates in both regions during 2010--2012 were low and unresponsive to chlorophyll or freshwater flow. Development indices, calculated as ratios of laboratory-derived to field-derived stage durations, were lowest for nauplii and highest for late copepodites, but averaged below 0.5 for all stages combined. Development indices were weakly related to chlorophyll for late copepodites only, unrelated to freshwater flow, and slightly higher in low-salinity than fresh water. Thus, the principal mechanism by which flow affects the P. forbesi population is apparently transport of copepods from fresh water to low-salinity water, where copepods are available to delta smelt. This work demonstrates how freshwater flow affects estuarine foodwebs through spatial subsidies of food supply.}

 journal = {Estuaries and Coasts},
 abstract = {Mortality of planktonic populations is difficult to determine because assumptions of the methods are rarely met, more so in estuaries where tidal exchange ensures violation of the assumption of a closed or spatially uniform population. Estuarine plankton populations undergo losses through movement from productive regions, creating a corresponding subsidy to regions that are less productive. We estimated mortality rates of the copepod Pseudodiaptomus forbesi in the San Francisco Estuary using a vertical-life-table approach with a Bayesian estimation method, combined with estimates of spatial subsidies and losses using a spatial box model with salinity-based boundaries. Data came from a long-term monitoring program and from three sample sets for 1991--2007 and 2010--2012. A hydrodynamic model coupled with a particle-tracking model supplied exchange rates between boxes and from each box to several sinks. In situ mortality, i.e., mortality corrected for movement, was highly variable. In situ mortality of adults was high (means by box and sampling program 0.1--0.9~day $-$1 ) and appeared invariant with salinity or year. In situ mortality of nauplii and copepodites increased from fresh ({\~{}} 0) to brackish water (means 0.4--0.8~day $-$1 ), probably because of consumption by clams and predatory copepods in brackish water. High mortality in the low-salinity box was offset by a subsidy which increased after 1993, indicating an increase in mortality. Our results emphasize the importance of mortality and spatial subsidies in structuring populations. Mortality estimates of estuarine plankton are feasible with sufficient sampling to overcome high variability, provided adjustments are made to account for movement.}

 abstract = {Green Bay, while representing only ,7{\%} of the surface area and ̃1.4{\%} of the volume of Lake Michigan, contains one-third of the watershed of the lake, and receives approximately one-third of the total nutrient loading to the Lake Michigan basin, largely from the Fox River at the southern end of the bay. With a history of eutrophic conditions dating back nearly a century, the southern portion of the bay behaves as an efficient nutrient and sediment trap, sequestering much of the annual carbon and nitrogen input within sediments accumulating at up to 1 cm per year. Depositional fluxes of organic matter varied from ̃0.1 mol C m-2 yr-1 to {\textgreater}10 mol C m-2 yr-1 and were both fairly uniform in stoichiometric composition and relatively labile. Estimates of benthic recycling derived from pore-water concentration gradients, whole-sediment incubation experiments, and deposition-burial models of early diagenesis yielded an estimated 40{\%} of the carbon and 50{\%} of the nitrogen recycled back into the overlying water. Remineralization was relatively rapid with ̃50{\%} of the carbon remineralized within {\textless}15 yr of deposition, and a mean residence time for metabolizable carbon and nitrogen in the sediments of 20 yr. On average, organic carbon regeneration occurred as 75{\%} CO2, 15{\%} CH4, and 10{\%} dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Carbon and nitrogen budgets for the southern bay were based upon direct measurements of inputs and burial and upon estimates of export and production derived stoichiometrically from a coupled phosphorus budget. Loadings of organic carbon from rivers were ̃3.7 mol m-2 yr-1, 80{\%} in the form of DOC and 20{\%} as particulate organic carbon. These inputs were lost through export to northern Green Bay and Lake Michigan (39{\%}), through sediment burial (26{\%}), and net CO2 release to the atmosphere (35{\%}). Total carbon input, including new production, was 4.54 mol m-2 C yr-1, equivalent to ̃10{\%} of the gross annual primary production. Nitrogen budget terms were less well quantified, with nitrogen export ̃54{\%} of total inputs and burial ̃24{\%}, leaving an unquantified residual loss term in the nitrogen budget of ̃22{\%}. {\copyright}2009.}

 abstract = {A coupled physical-ecosystem model is applied to Jakarta Bay to examine the role of physical processes on the ecosystem. The simulated physical processes include tides, river discharge, and monsoon winds. The potential sources of nitrogen to Jakarta Bay are through river inputs and wet deposition flux. The model separates the detritus compartment into pelagic and benthic components, based on cohesive sediment processes. Physical model results agree well with the observed tidal amplitude and phase, as well as tidal currents. The biological model can produce reasonable spatial and temporal patterns in lower trophic level characteristics of the ecosystem in some areas of the bay, although a lack of observed data limits confidence in model predictions. Model results show that the physical processes associated with monsoons produce an intensification of Chl a and nutrient concentrations in the eastern and western parts of the bay during northwest monsoon and southeast monsoon, respectively. The physical and biological characteristics of bay waters are controlled by influxes from offshore; the influence of river discharge is limited to the coastal area. The sensitivity of model predictions to the open boundary, river fluxes, and benthic detritus is discussed. {\copyright}2009 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

 abstract = {Finite freshwater sources are facing huge threats both for quality and quantity from uncertain global changes, namely population growth, rapid urbanization, and climate change. These threats are even more prominent in developing countries where institutional capacity of decision-makers in the field of water resources is not sufficient. Attention of scientific communities to work on adaptation barriers is increasing as the need for global change adaptation becomes apparent. This paper presents a comparative study of assessing the current water quality as well as predicting its future situation using different scenarios in eight different cities of South and Southeast Asia. The idea behind this transdisciplinary work (integrated use of hydrological science, climate science, social science, and local policies) is to provide scientific evidence to decision-makers to help them to implement right management policies at timely manner. Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP), a numerical simulation tool, was used to model river water quality using two scenarios, namely business as usual (BAU) and scenario with measures. Water quality simulation was done along one representative river from all eight cities. Simulated results for BAU scenario shows that water quality in all the study sites will further deteriorate by year 2030 compared to the current situation and will be not suitable for fishing category as desired by the local governments. Also, simulation outcome for scenario with measures advocating improvement of water quality compared to current situation signifies the importance of existing master plans. However, different measures (suggested upgradation of wastewater handling infrastructure) and policies will not be sufficient enough to achieve desirable river water quality as evident from the gap between concentration of simulated water quality and desirable water quality concentrations. This work can prove vital as it provides timely information to the decision-makers involved in keeping inventory for attaining SDG 6.0 in their regions and it also calls for immediate and inclusive action for better water resource management.}

 abstract = {Seasonal variations in species composition and growth dynamics of phytoplankton in Uzuncayir Dam Lake (Tunceli, Turkey) were studied in relation to ecological factors by collecting horizontal water and phytoplankton samples for over a year. A total of 46 phytoplankton taxa were recorded, where Bacillariophyta was the most abundant in species number representing 24 taxa. Diatoms were the most conspicuous phytoplankton in terms of abundance as well as occurrence frequency. Charophyta, Chlorophyta, Cyanobacteria, Ochrophyta, Miozoa, and Euglenozoa were the least abundant. However, some Diatoms (Gyrosigma attenuatum, Hippodonta hungarica, Meridion circulare, Nitzschia clausii, Nitzschia frustulum, Pantocsekiella ocellata, Rhoicosphenia abbreviata), Charophytes (Cosmarium granatum, Mougeotiopsis calospora), Cyanobacteria (Leiblenia epiphytica, Planktothrix agardhii); Dinoflagellates (Ceratium hirundinella, Parvodinium africanum, Parvodinium inconspicuum, Peridinium cinctum), and Ochrophyta (Dinobryon pediforme) were also noticeable, with their occurrence in all seasons. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were employed to analyze the relationship between occurrence and abundance of phytoplankton species as well as the ecological factors. The results showed that pH and the concentrations of NH4, NO3, and PO4 influenced seasonal occurrence and abundance of phytoplankton species in the lake. Uzuncayir Dam Lake may be classified as an oligotrophic lake with the mean value of nitrate 2.62~mg~L-1 and phosphate 0.23~mg~L-1 as supported by the occurrence of various phytoplankton groups. Findings related to pollution indices yielded that Uzuncayir Dam Lake is on the edge of the moderate state of organic pollution.}

 journal = {Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci.},
 abstract = {Coastal-water hypoxia is increasing globally due to global warming and urbanization, and the need to define management solutions to improve the water quality of coastal ecosystems has become important. The lower tidal Garonne River (TGR; southwestern France), characterized by the seasonal presence of a turbidity maximum zone (TMZ) and urban water discharge, is subject to episodic hypoxia events during low river flow periods in the summer. Future climatic conditions (higher temperature and summer droughts) and increasing urbanization could enhance hypoxia risks near the city of Bordeaux in the coming decades. A 3-D model of dissolved oxygen (DO) that couples hydrodynamics, sediment transport and biogeochemical processes was used to assess the efficiency of different management solutions for oxygenation of the TGR during summer low-discharge periods. We ran different scenarios of reductions in urban sewage overflows, displacement of urban discharges downstream from Bordeaux and/or temporary river flow support during the summer period. The model shows that each option mitigates hypoxia, but with variable efficiency over time and space. Sewage overflow reduction improves DO levels only locally near the city of Bordeaux. Downstream relocation of wastewater discharges allows for better oxygenation levels in the lower TGR. The support of low river flow limits the upstream TMZ propagation and dilutes the TGR water with well-oxygenated river water. Scenarios combining wastewater network management and low-water replenishment indicate an improvement in water quality over the entire TGR. These modelling outcomes constitute important tools for local water authorities to develop the most appropriate strategies to limit hypoxia in the TGR. Highlights.-A 3-D model shows different efficiencies of management actions to limit hypoxia.-Downstream relocation of wastewater discharge totally mitigates hypoxia.-Sewage overflow reduction improves DO levels but only locally.-Water replenishment improves DO in the upper estuary.}

 abstract = {Dissolved oxygen (DO) is a fundamental parameter of coastal water quality, as it is necessary to aquatic biota, and it provides an indication of organic matter decomposition in waters and their degree of eutrophication. We present here a 7 year time series of DO concentration and ancillary parameters (river discharge, water level, turbidity, temperature, and salinity) from the MAGEST high-frequency monitoring network, at four automated stations in the central and fluvial regions of the macrotidal Gironde Estuary, one of the largest European estuaries. The spatio-temporal variability of DO at different time scales was first related to the migration and position of the maximum turbidity zone in this extremely turbid estuary. Since 2005, the Gironde Estuary has recorded several borderline hypoxic situations (DO close to 2 mg L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) and a 7 day-long hypoxic event (DO {\textless}2 mg L{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) in July 2006. Summer hypoxia occurred exclusively in the fluvial, low salinity, and high turbidity sections of the estuary and was significantly more pronounced in front of the large urban area of Bordeaux (715-000 inhabitants). Detailed analysis of the data at the seasonal, neap-spring and semi-diurnal tidal time scales, reveals that hypoxia in this area occurred: (i) in the maximum turbidity zone; (ii) during the spring to neap tide transition; (iii) at highest water temperature; and (iv) at lowest river discharge; there was also evidence of an additional negative impact of sewage treatment plants of Bordeaux city. Enhancement of respiration by turbidity, temperature and inputs of domestic biodegradable organic matter and ammonia, versus renewal of waters and dispersion of reduced pollutants with the river discharge, appeared as the dominant antagonist processes that controlled the occurrence of summer hypoxia. In the context of long-term environmental changes (increase in temperature and population, decrease in summer river discharge), the occurrence of severe hypoxia could not be excluded in the next decades in the upstream reach of the Gironde Estuary. {\copyright}2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.}

The model demonstrates the high sensitivity of biogeochemical Si cycling in the coastal zone to anthropogenic pressures, such as river damming and global temperature rise.

 abstract = {This study presents the first regional-scale assessment of estuarine CO2 evasion along the US East Coast (25-45° N). The focus is on 42 tidal estuaries, which together drain a catchment of 697 000 km2 or 76 {\%} of the total area within this latitudinal band. The approach is based on the Carbon-Generic Estuary Model (C-GEM) that allows the simulation of hydrodynamics, transport, and biogeochemistry for a wide range of estuarine systems using readily available geometric parameters and global databases of seasonal climatic, hydraulic, and riverine biogeochemical information. Our simulations, performed using conditions representative of the year 2000, suggest that, together, US East Coast estuaries emit 1.9 Tg C yr-1 in the form of CO2, which corresponds to about 40 {\%} of the carbon inputs from rivers, marshes, and mangroves. Carbon removal within estuaries results from a combination of physical (outgassing of supersaturated riverine waters) and biogeochemical processes (net heterotrophy and nitrification). The CO2 evasion and its underlying drivers show important variations across individual systems, but reveal a clear latitudinal pattern characterized by a decrease in the relative importance of physical over biogeochemical processes along a north-south gradient. Finally, the results reveal that the ratio of estuarine surface area to the river discharge, S/Q (which has a scale of per meter discharged water per year), could be used as a predictor of the estuarine carbon processing in future regional- A nd global-scale assessments.}

 abstract = {The Seine River discharges over 700 Gg of carbon (C) every year into the sea mostly under the form of Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) and emits 445 Gg under the form of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere over its entire river network. The watershed, which drains 76,000 km2, is heavily populated with 18 106 inhabitants and is thus submitted to large anthropic pressure. The offline coupling of two Reactive Transport Models is used to understand the complex spatial and temporal dynamics of carbon, oxygen and nutrients and quantify the CO2 exchange at the air-water interface along the main axis of the river. The estuarine section of the Seine is simulated by the generic estuarine model C-GEM (for Carbon Generic Estuarine Model), while the upstream part of the network, devoid of tidal influence is simulated by the pyNuts-Riverstrahler modeling platform which also includes an explicit representation of the drainage network ecological functioning. Our simulations provide a process-based representation of nutrients, oxygen, total organic carbon (TOC) and the carbonate system (DIC and alkalinity) over the entire year 2010. Our coupled modelling chain allows quantifying the respective contributions of the estuarine and freshwater sections of the system in the removal of carbon as well as following the fate of TOC and DIC along the river network. Our results also allow calculating an integrated carbon budget of the Seine river network for year 2010.}

In this study, large-scale numerical models were created to simulate the long-term morphological processes along the Mekong River Delta coast. By using these models, key factors such as river currents, tides, sediment discharge, monsoon currents, waves, and salinity were calculated under various conditions, including seasonal variations of river flow, monsoon surface sea currents, and waves. The results show that the river flow rate determines erosion and deposition in the river. Furthermore, the river current combined with tidal current governs the development of narrow passages and islets. The effect of the interaction between the monsoon current and waves on the morphological processes of the coastline is significant. The monsoon current plays a major role in changing the shoreline, whereas wave action is a secondary factor that intensifies shoreline erosion, which is primarily influenced by sea current.}

 volume = {233},
 number = {October 2019},
 journal = {Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science},
 abstract = {The Mekong river is one of the largest rivers in the world, which flows through six countries of Southeast Asia (China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam). Its hydro-sedimentary regime is changing rapidly, as a consequence of a regional shift of land use (agriculture, road, etc.), damming, sand mining and climate changes, among others. This study assesses the behavior of particles transported in suspension in the Lower Mekong River (LMR), along approximately 1700 km from fluvial to estuarine environments. Suspended sediment properties were estimated, simultaneously with hydrodynamic conditions, during three field campaigns. In addition, further investigations were performed in the laboratory to assess the structures of particles (flocculated or not), their capacity to flocculate (and the impacts on siltation), under a wide range of sediment concentration (20--30,000 mg.L$-$1). This study confirms that suspended sediment transported in the LMR are predominantly (75{\%} by volume) flocculi (or freshly eroded soils aggregates), with median aggregated particle size in the range 10--20 \textgreek{m}m and median settling velocity of the order of 0.01--0.1 mm s$-$1. These flocculi are robust under the hydrodynamic conditions (turbulence and suspended sediment concentration -- SSC) existing in the LMR. Laboratory investigations reveal the existence of a threshold sediment concentration (400 mg.L$-$1), beyond which flocculation and sedimentation increase of orders of magnitudes. Thus, concentration that exceeds this threshold might promote the formation of so-called fluid mud layers. Because of the nonlinear response of flocculation and sedimentation with SSC and considering the ongoing changes at a regional scale in the LMR, higher occurrence of fluid mud layers in the fluvial upstream waterbodies might be anticipated, and a lower occurrence in estuaries and alongshore where the concentration decrease. The geomorphology could be impacted, with an over-siltation in dams and an exacerbated erosion of the muddy-mangrove coast.}

However, changes in the behaviour of climate systems can lead to nonstationarity in flood series. Here, we develop flood hazard maps for Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, under nonstationary conditions using extreme value analysis, a coupled 1D--2D model and high-resolution topographical data derived from LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data. Our findings indicate that ENSO (El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation) and PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) influence the magnitude and frequency of extreme rainfall, while global sea-level rise causes nonstationarity in local sea levels, having an impact on flood risk. The detailed flood hazard maps show that areas of high flood potential are located along river banks, with 0.60 km2 of the study area being unsafe for people, vehicles and buildings (H5 zone) under a 100-year return period scenario.}

The numerical model was developed based on the streamline-upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) where a finite element grid was used in order to treat the complex geometry of the natural water bodies. Velocity fields for the input data of pollutant transport simulation were obtained using a 2D hydrodynamic model, RMA2. The pollutant transport simulations in both the steady state flow and in the tidal currents were carried out to analyze the effects of tidal currents on the 2D concentration distribution in the region of application. The simulation results show that, with increasing water level period under tidal conditions, very large recirculation zones occurs and water flows in the upstream direction. Therefore, within the tidal currents, the polluted water goes back and forth with variations in the flow direction. As a result of this movement of pollutant, an oscillation in the concentration appears over time, which reflects both the significantly complex periodic variation in the flow pattern and large circulations. {\copyright}2007 International Association for Hydraulic Engineering and Research, Asia Pacific Division.}

Its best-known manifestations are toxic cyanobacteria blooms in lakes and waterways and proliferations of green macro algae in coastal areas. The term eutrophication is used by both the scientific community and public policy-makers, and therefore has a myriad of definitions. The introduction by the public authorities of regulations to limit eutrophication is a source of tension and debate on the activities identified as contributing or having contributed decisively to these phenomena. Debates on the identification of the driving factors and risk levels of eutrophication, seeking to guide public policies, have led the ministries in charge of the environment and agriculture to ask for a joint scientific appraisal to be conducted on the subject. Four French research institutes were mandated to produce a critical scientific analysis on the latest knowledge of the causes, mechanisms, consequences and predictability of eutrophication phenomena. This paper provides the methodology and the main findings of this two years exercise involving 40 scientific experts.}

 journal = {Environ. Sci. Policy},
 abstract = {Following the COP 21, it has been widely recognized that agricultural soils may contribute toward mitigating or enhancing climate change depending on their behavior as a sink or a source of carbon (C) to the atmosphere. Here, we studied the case of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in French cropland at the regional scale from 1852 to 2014 by coupling the GRAFS approach (Generalized Representation of Agro-Food System) with the AMG model (after its authors names: Andriulo, Mary, Gu{\'e}rif). Our results emphasize the role of crop net primary production (NPP) as the main driver of changes in SOC stocks through the input of crop residues. Three distinct phases of NPP were identified: (1) from 1852 to 1950, a slow rise in NPP occurred, which induced a moderate increase of cropland SOC pools (1--2‰ yr$-$1); (2) from 1950 to 1980, NPP increased considerably, resulting in a much higher rate of SOC accumulation (2--4‰ yr$-$1); (3) from 1980 to 2014, divergent trajectories were followed according to regions with either a slowdown in NPP growth with moderate increase in SOC stocks (0--2‰ yr$-$1), or a reversed trend toward declining NPP induced by a reduction of fodder production, replaced by imported feed which led to negative change of cropland SOC stocks. We highlight that these evolutions of carbon dynamics in cropland were closely linked to changes in the French social political context, from the second Empire to the Cold War and the advent of a neo-liberal era. As a whole, for France, we found a rate of C sequestration in the top 30 cm of cropland soils of about 1.7 Mt C yr$-$1 for the last two decades, less than one fifth of the current fossil-fuel-based CO2 emission rate of the French agricultural sector which exceeds 8 Mt C yr$-$1. Our study showed that in developed countries like France, where a sharp increase in cropland SOC stocks occurred owing to the modernization of agriculture, this should be considered as a ``fossil-fuel-powered carbon sink'' which does only partly compensate for the direct emissions through mechanization and fertilizer production that induced it.}

 abstract = {The biochemical processes and associated water quality in many lakes mainly depend on their transport behaviors. Most existing methodologies for investigating transport behaviors are based on physically based numerical models. The pollutant transport trajectory and residence time of Poyang Lake are thought to have important implications for the steadily deteriorating water quality and the associated rapid environmental changes during the flood period. This study used a hydrodynamic model (MIKE 21) in conjunction with transport and particle-tracking sub-models to provide comprehensive investigation of transport behaviors in Poyang Lake. Model simulations reveal that the lake's prevailing water flow patterns cause a unique transport trajectory that primarily develops from the catchment river mouths to the downstream area along the lake's main flow channels, similar to a river-transport behavior. Particle tracking results show that the mean residence time of the lake is 89 days during July-September. The effect of the Yangtze River (the effluent of the lake) on the residence time is stronger than that of the catchment river inflows. The current study represents a first attempt to use a combined model approach to provide insights into the transport behaviors for a large river-lake system, given proposals to manage the pollutant inputs both directly to the lake and catchment rivers.}

 volume = {151},
 journal = {Marine Pollution Bulletin},
 abstract = {Several large semi-enclosed seas and coastal bodies have formed seasonal hypoxic water masses over large areas. The dominant cause for such formations is believed to be the increasing inflow of nutrients from watersheds and urban areas into estuaries and coastal waters. Several studies have reported hypoxic events in the Pearl River estuary (PRE). However, hypoxia events appear to be episodic, which are neither seasonal nor estuary-wide. The reasons for such occurrences are not understood fully. The objectives of this study are to use 24-year time series data obtained during 1988-2011 to analyze the long-term variability in dissolved oxygen (DO) in summer over the entire estuary from urban areas to estuarine coastal waters and examine regulating factors for the occurrences of hypoxia. The results showed that various regulating factors were responsible for the variability of DO in different regions of the PRE. DO decreased in the urban reach, upstream and main estuarine zones of the PRE from about 2000. It was hypoxic (DO {\textless}2.0~mg~L-1) in the urban reach zone and periodic low DO (DO {\textless}3.5~mg~L-1) and episodic hypoxic in the upstream zone after 2000, mainly influenced by the increasing sewage discharge. The main estuarine zone experienced episodic low DO and sporadic hypoxia after 2000. The ecosystem buffering capacity was characterized by turbidity, well vertical mixing and short residence time which diluted the pressure for the formation of hypoxia. The eastern shelf appeared to be more vulnerable to hypoxia because of its deeper topography, plume front position, and stratification of the water column compared with the western shelf. Its bottom waters experienced seasonal low DO but seldom hypoxia. In comparison, low DO rarely occurred in the western shelf because of its shallow topography and short residence time. In brief, 24-year series data captured from 1988 to 2011 showed a lack of seasonal and estuary-wide hypoxia in the PRE.}

 abstract = {Greenhouse gases (GHGs) have long received public attention because they affect the Earth's climate by producing the greenhouse effect. Freshwaters are an important source of GHGs, and the enhancement in their eutrophic status affects GHG emissions. Along with the increasing eutrophication of water bodies, the relevant quantitative and qualitative studies of the effects of freshwater eutrophication on GHG emissions have made substantial progress, particularly in the past 5~years. However, to our knowledge, this is the first critical review to focus on the role of freshwater eutrophication in GHG emissions. In this review, the emissions of common GHGs from freshwater are quantitatively described. Importantly, direct (i.e., dissolved oxygen, organic carbon, and nutrients) and indirect factors (i.e., dominant primary producer and algal blooms) affecting GHG emissions from eutrophic freshwater are systematically analyzed. In particular, the existence and significance of feedback loops between freshwater eutrophication and GHG emissions are emphasized considering the difficulties managing freshwater ecosystems and the Earth's climate. Finally, several future research directions as well as mitigation measures are described to provide useful insight into the dynamics and control of GHG emissions.}

The horizontal two-dimensional model considers the hydrodynamic, sediment transport, dissolved oxygen and nutrient cycling processes. In particular, the effect of sediment suspension and deposition on the nutrient distribution in the water column has been included in the model. A TVD-MacCormack scheme has been adopted to numerically solve the coupled partial differential equations. Field surveys and laboratory experiments in connection with the Loughor Estuary were conducted to obtain measured data for model calibration and verification. It was found that the linear isotherm model gave a good approximation of the adsorption/desorption processes over the range of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations measured in the natural estuary. Through experiments on the collected soil samples, the salinity-dependent partition ratios between the adsorbed and dissolved nutrients were determined. The results of the established model showed good agreement with the measured data. Finally, the model was used to examine the implications of changing the sewage effluent discharge scheme on the nutrient distributions in the estuary. {\copyright}2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

 abstract = {In order to examine system responses to high river discharge events and nutrient loading variations from the drainage basin, a coupled three-dimensional hydrodynamic and water quality model was applied in the Cape Fear River Estuary (CFRE) and its adjacent coastal region. An empirical equation was introduced in the model to represent light limitation for phytoplankton growth due to chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Model results show that in the upper to middle estuary, light limitation controls phytoplankton growth while in the lower estuary phytoplankton growth appears to be limited by light intensity during high flow periods, but by nutrient availability during low flow periods. In the coastal ocean, nutrient availability is usually the dominant limiting factor for primary production. Two sensitivity model tests were conducted to predict the system response to reductions in nutrient loading from the drainage basin. By reducing river discharge, the model results show that phytoplankton growth was enhanced within CFRE due to alleviated light limitation and increased residence time. More nutrients were consumed within the CFRE, and less were exported to the coastal region. By reducing nutrient concentrations at the head of the estuary, chlorophyll a concentrations within the CFRE were decreased. Less nutrients were consumed within the CFRE, and only slightly less were exported to the coastal region. The supply of light limiting substances during high flow events acted against the effect of riverine nutrient enhancement on phytoplankton growth, creating a negative feedback mechanism. {\copyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {The Danshuei Estuary is distinctive for the relatively short residence time (1-2 d) of its estuarine water and the very high concentration of ammonia, which is the dominant species of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the estuary, except near the river mouth. These characteristics make the dynamics of nitrogen cycling distinctively different from previously studied estuaries and result in unusual isotopic compositions of particulate nitrogen (PN). The $δ$15NPN values ranging from - 16.4‰ to 3.8‰ lie in the lower end of nitrogen isotopic compositions (- 16.4 to + 18.7‰) of suspended particulate matter observed in estuaries, while the $δ$13C values of particulate organic carbon (POC) and the C/N (organic carbon to nitrogen) ratios showed rather normal ranges from - 25.5‰ to - 19.0‰ and from 6.0 to 11.3, respectively. There were three major types of particulate organic matter (POM) in the estuary: natural terrigenous materials consisting mainly of soils and bedrock-derived sediments, anthropogenic wastes and autochthonous materials from the aquatic system. During the typhoon induced flood period in August 2000, the flux-weighted mean of $δ$13CPOC values was - 24.4‰, that of $δ$15NPN values was + 2.3‰ and that of C/N ratio was 9.3. During non-typhoon periods, the concentration-weighted mean was - 23.6‰ for $δ$13CPOC, - 2.6‰ for $δ$15NPN and 8.0 for C/N ratio. From the distribution of $δ$15NPN values of highly polluted estuarine waters, we identified the waste-dominated samples and calculated their mean properties: $δ$13CPOC value of - 23.6 $\pm$ 0.7‰, $δ$15NPN value of - 3.0 $\pm$ 0.1‰ and C/N ratio of 8.0 $\pm$ 1.4. Using a three end-member mixing model based on $δ$15NPN values and C/N ratios, we calculated contributions of the three major allochthonous sources of POC, namely, wastes, soils and bedrock-derived sediments, to the estuary. Their contributions were, respectively, 83{\%}, 12{\%} and 5{\%} under non-typhoon conditions, and 9{\%}, 63{\%} and 28{\%} under typhoon conditions. The autochthonous POM had the most varied isotopic compositions, encompassing the full ranges of $δ$13CPOC (- 25.5 to - 19.1‰), $δ$15NPN (- 16.4-3.8‰) and C/N ratio (6.0-11.3). The heavy end of the carbon isotopic composition reflected the typical marine condition and the lower end the estuarine condition, which probably had elevated concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon with low $δ$13C values due to input from decomposition of organic matter. The lack of isotopically heavy PN, as found in larger estuaries, was attributed to isotopically light starting materials, namely, anthropogenic wastes, the slow phytoplankton growth within the estuary and the rather short residence time; the latter two factors made 15N enrichment during ammonia consumption very limited. The most isotopically light PN likely originated from phytoplankton incorporating 15N-depleted nitrate near the river mouth, where ammonia inhibition of nitrate uptake probably stopped. {\copyright}2007 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {The seasonal variation of phytoplankton growth in the East China Sea (ECS) is simulated with a three-dimensional coupled physical-biogeochemical model, which includes discharges from Changjiang (Yangtze River). The purpose is to determine the main control on the seasonality of primary productivity in the ECS shelf, which nurtures rich biological resources. The model has a horizontal resolution of 1/6° in the domain from 23°N to 41°N and from 116°E to 134°E, excluding the Japan/East Sea, and 33 layers in the vertical. The nitrogen-based biogeochemical model has four compartments: dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), phytoplankton, zooplankton and detritus. The chlorophyll to phytoplankton ratio depends on light and DIN availability. The model is driven by monthly climatological winds with the sea-surface temperature, salinity and DIN relaxed towards the climatological mean values. It successfully reproduces the observed seasonal variation of primary productivity over the ECS shelf with a strong peak in later spring and summer. The modeled annual mean primary production (PP) over the entire ECS shelf is 441mgCm-2d-1, which falls within the reported range of 390-529mgCm-2d-1. It also reproduces the marked seaward gradient of DIN that decreases away from the Changjiang plume. Strong dependency on the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is demonstrated for primary production. For 1{\%} change in PAR 0.7{\%} change in PP is effected. Numerical experiments show that the strong summer peak of DIN load from Changjiang cannot generate the seasonality of PP without the seasonal cycle of PAR. On the other hand, the model can still produces the seasonal pattern with Changjiang nutrient load set to zero, indicating light availability as the major control. Yet the Changjiang DIN load induces a PP increase of 77mgCm-2d-1, which represents 13-20{\%} of the observation based estimates of PP. It is noted that the increase in nitrogen uptake associated with PP is 2.7 times the DIN provided by the Changjiang discharge, implying efficient recycling of the riverine nutrients in the shelf water. The model needs improvement on the sluggish dispersion of the Changjiang plume and insufficient vertical mixing. It also needs a more complicated biogeochemical model with more size classes of organisms, multiple-nutrient schemes and additional geochemical processes. {\copyright}2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The water quality model considers various species of nitrogen, phosphorus, organic carbon, and phytoplankton as well as dissolved oxygen and is driven by a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model. The hydrodynamic and water quality models were validated with observations of water surface elevation, velocity, salinity distribution, and water quality parameters. Statistical error analysis shows that predictions of hydrodynamics, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and nutrients from the model simulation quantitatively agreed with the observed data. The validated model was then applied to predict water quality conditions as a result of a reduction in nutrient loadings based on different engineering strategies. The simulated results revealed that the dissolved oxygen concentration would increase significantly and would be higher than 2~mg/L in the main stream and in three tributaries to meet the minimum statutory requirement for dissolved oxygen. Active estuarine management focused on the reduction of anthropogenic nutrient loads is needed for improvement in water quality.}

 abstract = {With the growing attention on global warming, understanding the main drivers of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is important. This paper investigated the contribution of intrinsic reasons for consumption-based GHG emissions growth using structural decomposition analysis based on world input-output database from 1995 to 2009. The drivers are decomposed into five sub-effects at both country-level and industry-level. The results are as follows: (1) The rapid global economic growth is the dominating driving force. However, a decreasing emission intensity caused by the improvement of energy efficiency and technology innovation can contribute significantly to emission reduction; (2) Key factors contributing to GHG emissions vary in different country groups. The investment effects in developing countries are overwhelming those in developed countries. Instead, the net export effects in developed countries are greater than them in developing countries, which means that developing countries are becoming pollution haven; (3) China and India are still the key contributors of CO2 growth and CH4 growth. In developing countries, the total effects of N2O emissions changes are positive, which is mainly because agriculture plays an important role in these countries; (4) Cluster analysis depicts the relationship between growth of GHG emissions and gross domestic outputs in different countries.}

 abstract = {Spatio-temporal patterns of the chlorophyll-a concentration, Chla, have been assessed from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) over the whole Vietnamese coastal waters from 2002 to 2012. For that purpose, six bio-optical algorithms already documented and based on different approaches have been tested over a large in situ data set collected at different seasons and locations along the Vietnamese coast. The OC5 algorithm (Gohin, Druon, and Lampert, 2002) presents the best performances and has been selected to assess Chla in the studied region. The notion of optimal bio-optical environment associated with the best performance of OC5 has been introduced. For suspended particulate matter concentration, SPM, lower than 100~g·m$-$~3, and colored dissolved organic matter, acdom(443), lower than 0.5~m$-$~1, Chla is estimated with an uncertainty of 36{\%} and a bias of 5{\%}. A Chla climatology has been generated and the temporal patterns (seasonal variability, long term trend, and irregular component) have been described using the Census-X-11 time series decomposition method. Three-dimensional hydrodynamical numerical simulations have been used to analyze the spatio-temporal patterns of Chla. The seasonal contribution dominates the variance of the signal, in good relationship with the dynamic of the mixed layer depth as well as with the occurrence of a seasonal upwelling induced by the summer monsoon. The irregular variability of Chla which may reach up to 35{\%} of the total variance in the central part of the Vietnamese coast, can be explained through the surface kinetic energy and its standard deviation which is associated with small scales processes. A long term monotonic trend from about 2 to {\textgreater}5{\%}·yr$-$~1 (that is 20 to {\textgreater}50{\%} from 2002 to 2012) have been noticed in different coastal areas where aquaculture activities exhibit a concurrence increase, ranging from 31{\%} to 113{\%} (in production weight) over the same time period. In situ measurements, and especially of nutrients, are however necessary to confirm the link between aquaculture activities and phytoplankton biomass long term evolutions.}

We analyzed the joint effects of eutrophication, derived from sewage pollution, and climate at the base of the pelagic food web in the Bah{\'i}a Blanca Estuary (SW Atlantic Ocean). A two-year survey of environmental conditions and microplankton communities was conducted in two sites affected by contrasting anthropogenic eutrophication conditions. Under severe eutrophication, we found higher phytoplankton abundance consistently dominated by smaller sized, non siliceous species, while microzooplankton abundance remained lower and nutrient stoichiometry showed conspicuous deviations from the Redfield ratio. Phytoplankton growth in such conditions appeared controlled by phosphorous. In turn, microplankton biomass and phytoplankton size ratio ({\textless}20\textgreek{m}m:{\textgreater}20\textgreek{m}m) displayed a saturation relationship with nutrients in the highly eutrophic area, although mean phytoplankton growth was similar in both eutrophic systems. The strength of links within the estuarine network, quantified through path analysis, showed enhanced relationships under larger anthropogenic eutrophication, which fostered the climate influence on microplankton communities. Our results show conspicuous effects of severe sewage pollution on the ecological stoichiometry, i.e., N and P excess with respect to Si, altering nutrient ratios for microplankton communities. This warns on wide consequences on food web dynamics and ultimately in ecosystem assets of coastal pelagic environments.}

 journal = {Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science},
 abstract = {The Yellow River is the second largest river in China and is well-known for its high sediment load. Since 2002, water-sediment regulation has been performed annually to scour the silted river channel in the lower reaches and to promote release of sediment from the large reservoirs. Here we present a comprehensive study of the variations in distribution and emission of dissolved N2O in the lower reaches of the Yellow River and its estuary based on: (i) monthly sampling at a lower-river station (Kenli) from November 2008 to December 2009, (ii) daily monitoring at this station during the water-sediment regulation event in summer of 2009, and (iii) field surveys of the estuary before, during, and after the regulation event. N2O concentrations in the lower reaches of the Yellow River ranged from 8.78 to 24.26 nmol/L, and had high values in winter and spring. N2O flux from the Yellow River to the Bohai Sea was about 2.27 $\times$ 105 mol/year. Water-sediment regulation had a strong impact on N2O distribution and transportation in the lower Yellow River. A sharp increase of N2O (8-fold) occurred at the beginning of water-sediment regulation, and this excessive N2O was likely from stimulation of nitrification in the water column. A total of 55.9{\%} of the annual N2O input from the Yellow River to the Bohai Sea occurred during water-sediment regulation, but the corresponding water discharge during this period accounted for only 26.9{\%} of total runoff. N2O concentrations in the lower reaches of the Yellow River and its estuary were almost all super-saturated, and this region acted as a net source of atmospheric N2O. High N2O saturations and air-sea fluxes were present in the Yellow River estuary during water-sediment regulation. These results indicate that water-sediment regulation in the Yellow River has a great impact on the estuarine distribution and atmospheric emission of N2O, and that this effect lasts for several weeks.},

 abstract = {Danish estuaries are characterised by being shallow, eutrophic and with high benthic biomass dominated by suspension feeders. However, the standing stock of benthic fauna is often higher than would be expected from the relation to residence time of sea water or to annual primary production found in other estuaries. The present study investigated how the biomass of benthic suspension feeders was regulated by food supply produced due to eutrophication and supplied to the benthos by vertical mixing. This was tested using a 1D water column model calibrated and validated against monitoring data from a 5. years period in the Limfjorden. The model described vertical hydrodynamics and -pelagic biogeochemistry, sediment dynamics and was coupled to a Dynamic Energy Budget model for blue mussels. The modelled biomass of blue mussels showed a dome-shaped relationship to water column stability that was most pronounced combined with high nutrient loadings. At strong stratification, there was little coupling between the upper productive layer and mussels causing food limitation. In addition, hypoxia induced mass mortality of mussels during summer at high nutrient loadings. Under well-mixed conditions, mussels were capable of depleting phytoplankton in the whole water column and food limitation occurred resulting in a lower annual mussel biomass. The optimal conditions for growth of benthic suspension feeders in the long term would therefore be periods of stratification that are long enough to allow the phytoplankton to bloom at the surface layer and short enough to prevent benthic suspension feeders from starving or suffer from hypoxia. {\copyright}2010 Elsevier B.V.}

 abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from inland waters remain a major source of uncertainty in global greenhouse gas budgets. N2O emissions are typically estimated using emission factors (EFs), defined as the proportion of the terrestrial nitrogen (N) load to a water body that is emitted as N2O to the atmosphere. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has proposed EFs of 0.25{\%} and 0.75{\%}, though studies have suggested that both these values are either too high or too low. In this work, we develop a mechanistic modeling approach to explicitly predict N2O production and emissions via nitrification and denitrification in rivers, reservoirs and estuaries. In particular, we introduce a water residence time dependence, which kinetically limits the extent of denitrification and nitrification in water bodies. We revise existing spatially explicit estimates of N loads to inland waters to predict both lumped watershed and half-degree grid cell emissions and EFs worldwide, as well as the proportions of these emissions that originate from denitrification and nitrification. We estimate global inland water N2O emissions of 10.6--19.8~Gmol~N~year$-$1 (148--277~Gg~N~year$-$1), with reservoirs producing most N2O per unit area. Our results indicate that IPCC EFs are likely overestimated by up to an order of magnitude, and that achieving the magnitude of the IPCC's EFs is kinetically improbable in most river systems. Denitrification represents the major pathway of N2O production in river systems, whereas nitrification dominates production in reservoirs and estuaries.}

 abstract = {The Taw Estuary (SW England) is eutrophic as a result of enhanced nutrient inputs from its catchment. However, factors influencing the timing and extent of phytoplankton bloom formation are not fully understood in this system. In this study, high resolution chemical and biological sampling was undertaken in late-winter/spring and summer 2008 in order to gain further insights into bloom dynamics in the Taw Estuary. Temporal variations in chlorophyll a maxima in the upper and middle estuary during summer were controlled by river flow and tidal amplitude, with nutrient limitation probably less important. Concentrations of chlorophyll a were highest during low river flow and neap tides. Increased river flows advected the chlorophyll maximum to the outer estuary, and under highest river discharges, chlorophyll a concentrations were further reduced. This feature was even more pronounced when spring tides coincided with high flows. The main bloom species were the diatoms Asterionellopsis glacialis and Thalassiosira guillardii. Using two multivariate statistical techniques in combination, five distinct physical and biogeochemical states in the Taw estuarine waters were identified. These states can be summarised as: A(1), high chlorophyll a, high temperature, long residence times, nutrient depletion; A(2), strong coastal water influence; B(1), decreasing chlorophyll a, increasing river flow and/or spring tides; B(2), transitional between states A(1) and B(3); B(3), high river flow. It was thus possible to differentiate between contrasting environmental conditions that were either beneficial or detrimental for the development of algal blooms. A conceptual model of diatom - dominated primary production for the Taw Estuary is proposed which describes how physical controls (river flow, tidal state) moderate plankton biomass production in the upper and mid - estuarine regions.}

 journal = {Regional Studies in Marine Science},
 abstract = {Estuaries are highly productive ecosystems, and estuarine emission of N2O contributes significantly to the global nitrogen (N) budget. Presented here are the spatio-temporal distribution and water--air flux of N2O from a monsoonal, tropical estuary, the Mandovi located off Goa, during three consecutive years of 2011, 2012 and 2013. Despite substantial input from various sources, the estuary was moderately enriched with nitrogenous nutrients ($\leq$30\textgreek{m}M). However, the N transformations do not seem to contribute towards considerable emissions of N2O. Nonetheless, the seasonal upwelling along the west coast of India influences the water column chemistry at the estuarine mouth, as the upwelled water intrudes $\sim$13 km inside the estuary, leading to significant changes in terms of N2O cycling. A high build-up of N2O in the bottom waters was observed annually during peak southwest monsoon (SWM). The highest concentrations of N2O $\sim$164 nM ($\sim$2459 {\%}, August 2011), 106 nM ($\sim$1566 {\%}, September 2012), and 156 nM ($\sim$2320 {\%}, August 2013) were recorded at the estuarine mouth that was associated with a coastally-derived upwelled water mass. However, the average concentrations of N2O during pre- and post-monsoon were 10.88 $\pm$ 2.07 nM and 11.07 $\pm$ 2.85 nM, respectively, for the three years. The water--air flux of N2O was highest during SWM and was lowest during pre- and post-monsoons. The average flux by the estuary varied from $\sim$3.98 - 48.46\textgreek{m}mol m$-$2d$-$1. The average annual emission from the Mandovi estuary was estimated to be $\sim$5.5 $\times$ 106 g N2O y$-$1, which seems to be a smaller fraction when compared to coastal emissions. Our study suggests that while the Mandovi estuary remains in saturation with respect to N2O, it acts as a modest source of N2O to the atmosphere, especially during SWM.}

 abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from rivers and lakes have been shown to contribute significantly to global carbon and nitrogen cycling. In temperate and human-impacted regions, simultaneous carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions from aquatic systems are poorly documented. We estimated carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the Seine hydrosystem (71,730 km2, France) using direct measurements, and calculations of CO2 partial pressures from 14 field campaigns conducted between 2010 and 2017, and compared them to methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations. In the main stem of the Seine River, CO2 showed the same spatial gradient as N2O and CH4 with peaks in concentration downstream from the arrival of effluents from wastewater treatment plants enriched in organic matter, thus favoring mineralization. It is likely that high CO2 concentrations upstream were due to organic carbon inputs from soils and enriched CO2 groundwater discharges, whereas high N2O and CH4 upstream values were likely due to denitrification in riparian wet areas and anoxic decomposition of organic matter-rich wetlands, respectively. In addition, seasonal variations in all three GHGs were observed with higher concentrations in summer when higher temperatures promote mineralization and low water reduces the dilution of organic matter mainly originating from WWTP effluents. GHG emissions were calculated and compared with agricultural and nonagricultural (urban, transport) fluxes in the basin. In the Seine River network, CO2 emissions dominated riverine GHG emissions, reaching 95.3{\%}, while N2O and CH4 emissions accounted for 4.4{\%} and 0.3{\%}, respectively. These indirect emissions from the hydrosystem were estimated to account for 3.7{\%} of the total GHG emissions from the basin that amounted to 61,284 Gg CO2eq yr-1. Comparatively, direct agricultural and nonagricultural GHG emissions were estimated at 23.3{\%} and 73.0{\%}., respectively.}

We provide a detailed model description and present an overview of enhancements to input datasets, emphasizing an integrated view of nutrient form sub-models and contrasts with previous NEWS models (NEWS 1). An important difference with NEWS 1 is our unified model framework (multi-element, multi-form) that facilitates detailed watershed comparisons regionally and by element or form. NEWS 2 performs approximately as well as NEWS 1 while incorporating previously uncharacterized factors. Although contemporary global river export estimates for dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and particulates show notable reductions, they are within the range of previous studies; global exports for other nutrient forms are comparable to NEWS 1. NEWS 2 can be used as an effective tool to examine the impact of polices to reduce coastal eutrophication at regional to global scales. Continued enhancements will focus on the incorporation of other forms and sub-basin spatial variability in drivers and retention processes. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Hence, source attribution estimates beyond the scale of small catchments must rely on models. Although such estimates have been accomplished using individual models, there has not yet been a comparison of N source attribution predictions at large spatial scales. We compared results from two models applied to the continental US: Nutrient Export from WaterSheds (NEWS) and SPAtially Referenced Regressions On Watersheds (SPARROW). NEWS and SPARROW predictions for total N delivery to the US coastal zone were 373 and 429 kg N km-2 year-1, respectively, for the contemporary period. Despite differences in how inputs were represented and defined by the models, NEWS and SPARROW both identified the same single-largest N sources for 67 {\%} of the surface area that drains to the US coastal zone. When only anthropogenic sources were considered, agreement increased to 78 {\%} of surface area. Fertilizer and crop N-fixation were dominant in the Mississippi River Basin, where the bulk of agricultural lands are located. Sewage and population-related sources were most important in urban areas and natural N (primarily N-fixation on non-agricultural land) was most important in the Pacific Northwest. Attribution to fertilizer plus crop N-fixation, atmospheric deposition, and sewage and population-related sources was generally greater by SPARROW than NEWS, and the reverse was true for manure and natural sources. Nonetheless, both models agreed in attributing 62-81 {\%} of N delivered to the coastal zone in the continental US to human activities. {\copyright}2013 US Government.}

During both years {\textgreater}74{\%} of the nitrogen and {\textgreater}84{\%} of the phosphorus load entered the estuary during one month when flooding occurred in the catchment. Due to larger flood magnitude, loads during the 1995/96 year were 3.3 and 2.5 times greater than during the 1994/95 year for nitrogen and phosphorus respectively. During floods the estuarine basin was completely flushed of brackish water and the majority of the nutrient loads passed directly through the estuary. The nutrient load retained in the estuary during floods was inversely proportional to flood magnitude. Annual budgets show that {\textgreater}97{\%} of the nutrient load entering the estuary was from diffuse catchment sources; precipitation, urban runoff, and sewage were negligible. Less than 2.5{\%} of the nitrogen and {\textless}5.4{\%} of the phosphorus loads entering the estuary were retained in sediments. During dry seasons the estuary became a net sink for nitrogen input from the ocean and the estuarine sediments remained a net source of phosphorus to the water column and ocean. The process of flood scouring is likely to be the cleansing mechanism responsible for maintaining water quality both on an annual basis and over the last 50 years and may also be responsible for potential nitrogen limitation. The sub-tropical Richmond River estuary contrasts with the majority of temperate systems of North America and Europe which typically have lower inter- and intra-annual nutrient load variability, longer and less variable flushing times, and greater nutrient retention.}

 abstract = {The phytoplankton community composition, structure, and biomass were investigated under stratified and oligotrophic conditions during summer for three consecutive years in the Mediterranean Sea. Our results reveal that the phytoplankton community structure was strongly influenced by vertical stratification. The thermocline separated two different phytoplankton communities in the two layers of the euphotic zone, characterized by different nutrient and light availability. Picoplankton dominated in terms of abundance and biomass at all the stations sampled and throughout the photic zone. However, the structure of the picoplanktonic community changed with depth, with Synechococcus and heterotrophic prokaryotes dominating in surface waters down to the base of the thermocline, and Prochlorococcus and picoeukaryotes contributing relatively more to the community in the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM). Light and nutrient availability also influenced the communities at the DCM layer. Prochlorococcus prevailed in deeper DCM waters characterized by lower light intensities and higher picophytoplankton abundance was related to lower nutrient concentrations at the DCM. Picoeukaryotes were the major phytoplankton contributors to carbon biomass at surface (up to 80{\%}) and at DCM (more than 40{\%}). Besides, contrarily to the other phytoplankton groups, picoeukaryotes cell size progressively decreased with depth. Our research shows that stratification is a major factor determining the phytoplankton community structure; and underlines the role that picoeukaryotes might play in the carbon flux through the marine food web, with implications for the community metabolism and carbon fate in the ecosystem.}

 abstract = {The C/N and stable C and N isotope ratios ($δ$13C, $δ$15N) of sedimentary and suspended particulate matter were determined in the Schelde Estuary. Suspended matter was divided into 2 to 5 size fractions by centrifugation. Four major pools of organic matter were recognized: riverine, estuarine, marine and terrestrial materials. Terrestrial organic matter ($δ$13C $\simeq$ -26‰, $δ$15N $\simeq$ 3.5‰, C/N $\simeq$ 21) is important for the sedimentary pool, but suspended matter is dominated by the marine ($δ$13C $\simeq$ -18‰, $δ$15N $\simeq$ 9‰, C/N $\simeq$ 8), riverine ($δ$13C $\simeq$ -30‰, $δ$15 N $\simeq$ 9‰, C/N $\simeq$ 7.5) and estuarine ($δ$13C $\simeq$ -29‰, $δ$15N $\simeq$ 15‰ C/N $\simeq$ 8) end-members. In the upper estuary, the suspended matter size fractions vary systematically in their carbon and nitrogen biogeochemistry, with the small particles having low C/N ratios, depleted $δ$13C and enriched $δ$15N values relative to large particles. Moreover, sedimentary and suspended matter differ significantly in terms of C/N ratios (17 vs. 8.9), $δ$13C (-26.3 vs. -28.9‰) and $δ$15N (+6.9 vs. 12.0‰). In the lower estuary, suspended matter fractions are similar and sedimentary and suspended organic matter differ only in terms of $δ$13C (-23.5 vs. -20.1‰). Our data indicate that autochthonous organic matter contributes significantly to the total suspended matter and that the suspended organic matter composition cannot be explained in terms of conservative mixing of riverine and terrestrial sources on the one hand and marine sources on the other hand.}

 abstract = {Processing of organic matter in tidal estuaries modifies its transfer from the river to the sea. We examined the distribution and the elemental and isotopic composition of organic matter in nine tidal estuaries along the Atlantic coast of Europe (Elbe, Ems, Thames, Rhine, Scheldt, Loire, Gironde, Douro and Sado). Short-residence time estuaries such as the Douro and Rhine estuaries have low suspended matter (SPM) contents with variable organic carbon (OC) concentrations, but rather uniform $δ$15N values and C/N ratios. Carbon isotope ratios vary from - 20 to - 22‰ in the marine end-member to - 26 to - 30‰ in the river end-member with conservative mixing in between. Tidal-dominated estuaries have high SPM contents, rather uniform OC contents and C/N ratios, and uniform and intermediate $δ$13C values (- 24 to - 26‰). Organic matter in these intermediate to long residence time estuaries is extensively modified such that $δ$15N values may show enrichments up to 20‰ due to (heterotrophic) processing. Pools of dissolved and particulate organic matter appear to be involved in dynamic exchange reactions with their partitioning mainly governed by SPM concentration. The interaction of tidally induced cycles of deposition and erosion with this repartitioning of organic matter between dissolved and particulate pools due to changes in SPM concentration can be viewed as a chemical reactor with optimal solid-liquid exchange. As a consequence, riverine organic matter is extensively modified in tidal estuaries before it is transferred to the sea. {\copyright}2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}

This manuscript illustrates seasonal variation of biogeochemical flow dynamics in a tropical estuarine system in Zamb{\'e}zia province. The data were collected at 42 stations, including tidal current measurements with an Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, tidal elevation with a tidal-gauge and nitrate, silicate (SiO2), dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll-a with a photometer device system and tidal currents with multisensory instrument device (Current, Temperature and Depth device). These field data helped to calibrate a twelve months simulation of a 3D Computational Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics Model (3D CAEDM) in 2014. The results emphasize a tidal elevation of 4-m height that generated tidal currents of 120 cm/s. They combination with seasonal runoff of {\~{}}500 m3/s from Namacurra River and averaged bathymetry morphology of 10-m depth, led on to the seasonal concentration flux of dissolved oxygen, nitrate, SiO2 and chlorophyll-a during the ebbing and flooding. In addition, the river discharges were found to be the main source of nitrate and SiO2, while the tidal prism led on the hydrological flow of the brackish-waters during the rainy season with maximum salinity anomaly of 16{\%}. Besides the data obtained, the 3D model matches in reproducing the biogeochemical data flow have considerable potential possess of a valuable information in long- and short-term and large- and small-scale that may allow policy-makers to determine political decisions for bio-conservation, sustainability and coastal management.}

 abstract = {Concentrations of dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC), total suspended solids (TSS), were measured daily, and phytoplankton pigments (chlorophyll-a and pheopigments) were measured every 3 days at three strategic stations along the eutrophic Loire River between November 2011 and November 2013 marked by a high annual and seasonal variability in hydrological regimes. This unique high-frequency dataset allowed to determine the POC origin (autochthonous or allochthonous). Some strong relationships were evidenced between POC, total pigments and TSS and were tested on a long-term database with a lower frequency (monthly data) to reconstitute unmeasured algal and detrital POC concentrations and estimate annual total organic carbon (TOC) fluxes from 1980 onwards. The results were subjected to only $\approx$25 {\%} uncertainty and showed that the annual TOC fluxes at the outlet of the Loire River decreased from 520 10(3) tC year(-1) (i.e. 4.7 t km(-2) year(-1)) in the early 1990s to 150 10(3) tC year(-1) (i.e. 1.4 t km(-2) year(-1)) in 2012. Although DOC always dominates, the autochthonous POC represented 35 {\%} of the TOC load at the basin outlet by the end of the 1980s and declined to finally represent 15 {\%} only of the TOC. The control of phosphorus direct inputs and the invasion by Corbicula clams spp. which both occurred since the early 1990s probably highly reduced the development of phytoplankton. Consequently, the autochthonous POC contribution declined and TSS concentrations in summertime significantly decreased as well as a result of both less phytoplankton and less calcite precipitation. At the present time, at least 75 {\%} of the POC has allochthonous origins in the upper Middle Loire but downstream, autochthonous POC dominates during summer phytoplanktonic blooms when total pigments concentrations reach up to 70 \textgreek{m}g L(-1) (equivalent to 75 {\%} of the total POC).}

 journal = {The Science of the total environment},
 abstract = {Recent studies suggest that climate change, with warmer water temperatures and lower and longer low flows, may enhance harmful planktic cyanobacterial growth in lakes and large rivers. Concomitantly, controlling nutrient loadings has proven effective in reducing phytoplankton biomass especially in North America and Western Europe. In addition, the impact of invasive benthic filter-feeder species such as Corbicula on phytoplankton has largely been overlooked in large rivers, leading to even more uncertainty in predicting future trajectories in river water quality. To investigate how nutrient control, climate change and invasion of benthic filter-feeders may affect phytoplankton biomass and composition, we assembled a large database on the entire water course of the River Loire (France) over three decades (1991-2019). We focus on cyanobacteria to provide an in-depth analysis of the 30-year trend and insights on future possible trajectories. Since 1991, total phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomasses have decreased 10-fold despite warmer water temperature (+0.23~°C·decade-1) and lower summer flow (-0.25~L·s-1·km-2·decade-1). In the long-term, the contribution of planktic cyanobacteria to total biomass was on average 2.8{\%}. The main factors driving total phytoplankton and cyanobacteria biomasses were total phosphorus (4-fold decrease), the abundance of Corbicula clams (from absence before 1998 to 250-1250 individuals·m-2 after 2010), the duration of summer low flows and the intensity of summer heatwaves. The River Loire constitutes an example in Europe of how nutrient control can be an efficient mitigation strategy, counteracting already visible effects of climate change on the thermal regime and flow pattern of the river. This may hold true under future conditions, but further work is needed to account for the climate trajectory, land and water use scenarios, the risk of enhanced benthic biofilm and macrophyte proliferation, together with the spread of invasive filter-feeding bivalves.}

 abstract = {Even if humans stop discharging CO2 into the atmosphere, the average global temperature will still increase during this century. A lot of research has been devoted to prevent and reduce the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the atmosphere, in order to mitigate the effects of climate change. Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is one of the technologies that might help to limit emissions. In complement, direct CO2 removal from the atmosphere has been proposed after the emissions have occurred. But, the removal of all the excess anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 will not be enough, due to the fact that CO2 outgases from the ocean as its solubility is dependent of its atmospheric partial pressure. Bringing back the Earth average surface temperature to pre-industrial levels would require the removal of all previously emitted CO2. Thus, the atmospheric removal of other greenhouse gases is necessary. This article proposes a combination of disrupting techniques to transform nitrous oxide (N2O), the third most important greenhouse gas (GHG) in terms of current radiative forcing, which is harmful for the ozone layer and possesses quite high global warming potential. Although several scientific publications cite {\textquotedbl}greenhouse gas removal,{\textquotedbl} to our knowledge, it is the first time innovative solutions are proposed to effectively remove N2O or other GHGs from the atmosphere other than CO2.}

Nitrification rates ranged from undetectable to 166 nmol N L-1 h-1 in the water column and up to 17 nmol N (g wet wt)-1 h-1 in sediments. Nitrification rates were higher in intermediate salinities than in either freshwater or seawater end. Within this salinity range, nitrification rates could be related to ammonium concentrations. As shown by the relation between ammonification and nitrification rates, it is also likely that nitrification is more regulated by renewal rates, rather than by in situ concentrations, of substrate. Among other environmental parameters, temperature and pH may have an influence on nitrification. Potential nitrification rates calculated from loss of nitrite from N-Serve treated, nitrite-enriched samples were about 800 nmol N L-1 h-1 in the water column and 40 nmol N (g wet wt)-1 h-1 in sediments. While these rates are in balance with those of biological ammonium production they may be inadequate to mitigate ammonium pollution in this estuary. {\copyright}2007 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {The effects of advection, dispersion, and biological processes on nitrogen and phytoplankton dynamics after a storm event in December 2002 are investigated in an estuary located on the northern New South Wales coast, Australia. Salinity observations for 16 d after the storm are used to estimate hydrodynamic transports for a one-dimensional box model. A biological model with nitrogen limited phytoplankton growth, mussel grazing, and a phytoplankton mortality term is forced by the calculated transports. The model captured important aspects of the temporal and spatial dynamics of the bloom. A quantitative analysis of hydrodynamic and biological processes shows that increased phytoplankton biomass due to elevated nitrogen loads after the storm was not primarily regulated by advection or dispersion in spite of an increase in river flow from {\textless}1 to 928 $\times$ 103 m3 d-1. Of the dissolved nitrogen that entered the surface layer of the estuary in the 16 d following the storm event, the model estimated that 28{\%} was lost through exchange with the ocean or bottom layers, while 15{\%} was removed by the grazing of just one mussel species, Xenostrobus securis, on phytoplankton, and 50{\%} was lost through other biological phytoplankton loss processes. X. securis grazing remained an important loss process even when the estimated biological parameters in the model were varied by factors of $\pm$ 2. The intertidal mangrove pneumatophore habitat of X. securis allows filtering of the upper water column from the lateral boundaries when the water column is vertically stratified, exerting top-down control on phytoplankton biomass. {\copyright}2006 Estuarine Research Federation.}

Based on the synthesis, meta-analysis, and personal modeling experiences, we recommend coefficient of determination (R2; in conjunction with gradient and intercept of the corresponding regression line), Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), index of agreement (d), root mean square error (RMSE; alongside the ratio of RMSE and standard deviation of measured data, RSR), percent bias (PBIAS), and several graphical PMs to evaluate model performance. We recommend that model performance can be judged satisfactory for flow simulations if monthly R2 0.70 and d 0.75 for field-scale models, and daily, monthly, or annual R2 0.60, NSE 0.50, and PBIAS $\leq$ $\pm$15{\%} for watershed-scale models. Model performance at the watershed scale can be evaluated as satisfactory if monthly R2 0.40 and NSE 0.45 and daily, monthly, or annual PBIAS $\leq$ $\pm$20{\%} for sediment; monthly R20.40 and NSE 0.35 and daily, monthly, or annual PBIAS $\leq$ $\pm$30{\%} for phosphorus (P); and monthly R2 0.30 and NSE 0.35 and daily, monthly, or annual PBIAS $\leq$ $\pm$30{\%} for nitrogen (N). For RSR, we recommend that previously published PEC be used as detailed in this article. We also recommend that these PEC be used primarily for the four models for which there were adequate data, and used only with caution for other models. These PEC can be adjusted within acceptable bounds based on additional considerations, such as quality and quantity of available measured data, spatial and temporal scales, and project scope and magnitude, and updated based on the framework presented herein. This initial meta-analysis sets the stage for more comprehensive meta-analysis to revise PEC as new PMs and more data become available.}

The Humber is a highly dynamic, non steady state system and hence neither the biogeochemical zones nor the macrofaunal communities were sustained for long periods of time. Sediment mixing and resuspension on tidal, episodic or seasonal timescales was the predominant control on nutrients. Over an annual cycle, mean measured fluxes were -8.7 mmoles/m2/day nitrate, 3.7 mmoles/m2/day ammonia and 0.2 mmoles/m2/ day nitrite. Net phosphate and silicate fluxes were very small. The intertidal mudflats were a sink for nitrate (-1000 kmol/day), a major source of ammonia (430 kmol/day) and a minor source of nitrite (25 kmol/day). Nitrate influxes decreased in a seaward direction (-13.4 mmoles/m2/day in inner estuary, -11.0 mmoles/m2/day in mid-estuary, -5.2 mmoles/m2/day in outer estuary), but when the area of the mudflats in each area is taken into account, both the mid and outer estuary were sinks for approximately 40{\%} of the total nitrate taken up.

 abstract = {Estuaries are sources of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. However, our present knowledge of N2O and CH4 emissions from estuaries in the tropics is very limited because data are scarce. In this study, we present first measurements of dissolved N2O and CH4 from two estuaries in a peat-dominated region of northwestern Borneo. Two campaigns (during the dry season in June 2013 and during the wet season in March 2014) were conducted in the estuaries of the Lupar and Saribas rivers. Median N2O concentrations ranged between 7.2 and 12.3 nmol L-1 and were higher in the marine end-member (13.0 $\pm$ 7.0 nmol L-1). CH4 concentrations were low in the coastal ocean (3.6 $\pm$ 0.2 nmolg L-1) and higher in the estuaries (medians between 10.6 and 64.0 nmol L-1). The respiration of abundant organic matter and presumably anthropogenic input caused slight eutrophication, which did not lead to hypoxia or enhanced N2O concentrations, however. Generally, N2O concentrations were not related to dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentrations. Thus, the use of an emission factor for the calculation of N2O emissions from the inorganic nitrogen load leads to an overestimation of the flux from the Lupar and Saribas estuaries. N2O was negatively correlated with salinity during the dry season, which suggests a riverine source. In contrast, N2O concentrations during the wet season were not correlated with salinity but locally enhanced within the estuaries, implying that there were additional estuarine sources during the wet (i.e., monsoon) season. Estuarine CH4 distributions were not driven by freshwater input but rather by tidal variations. Both N2O and CH4 concentrations were more variable during the wet season. We infer that the wet season dominates the variability of the N2O and CH4 concentrations and subsequent emissions from tropical estuaries. Thus, we speculate that any changes in the Southeast Asian monsoon system will lead to changes in the N2O and CH4 emissions from these systems. We also suggest that the ongoing cultivation of peat soil in Borneo is likely to increase N2O emissions from these estuaries, while the effect on CH4 remains uncertain.}

 number = {9},
 journal = {Global Change Biology},
 abstract = {Nitrous oxide is a powerful, long-lived greenhouse gas, but we know little about the role of estuarine areas in the global N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O budget. This review summarizes 56 studies of N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O fluxes and associated biogeochemical controlling factors in estuarine open waters, salt marshes, mangroves, and intertidal sediments. The majority of in situ N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O production occurs as a result of sediment denitrification, although the water column contributes N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O through nitrification in suspended particles. The most important factors controlling N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O fluxes seem to be dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and oxygen availability, which in turn are affected by tidal cycles, groundwater inputs, and macrophyte density. The heterogeneity of coastal environments leads to a high variability in observations, but on average estuarine open water, intertidal and vegetated environments are sites of a small positive N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O flux to the atmosphere (range 0.15-0.91; median 0.31; Tg N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O-N yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}). Global changes in macrophyte distribution and anthropogenic nitrogen loading are expected to increase N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O emissions from estuaries. We estimate that a doubling of current median NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} concentrations would increase the global estuary water-air N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O flux by about 0.45 Tg N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O-N yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} or about 190{\%}. A loss of 50{\%} of mangrove habitat, being converted to unvegetated intertidal area, would result in a net decrease in N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O emissions of 0.002 Tg N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O-N yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. In contrast, conversion of 50{\%} of salt marsh to unvegetated area would result in a net increase of 0.001 Tg N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O-N yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. Decreased oxygen concentrations may inhibit production of N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O by nitrification; however, sediment denitrification and the associated ratio of N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O:N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} is expected to increase.}

 abstract = {The relationships between phytoplankton productivity, nutrient distributions, and freshwater flow were examined in a seasonal study conducted in Escambia Bay, Florida, USA, located in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. Five sites oriented along the salinity gradient were sampled 24 times over the 28-mo period from 1999 to 2001. Water column profiles of temperature and salinity were measured along with surface chlorophyll and surface inorganic nutrient concentrations. Primary productivity was measured at 2 sites on 11 dates, and estimated for the remaining dates and sites using an empirical regression model relating phytoplankton net production to the product of chlorophyll, euphotic zone depth, and daily solar insolation. Freshwater flow into the system varied markedly over the study period with record low flow during 2000, a flood event in March 2001, and subsequent resumption of normal flow. Flushing times ranged from 1 d during the flood to 20 d during the drought. Freshwater input strongly affected surface salinity distributions, nutrient flux, chlorophyll, and primary productivity. The flood caused high turbidity and rapid flushing, severely reducing phytoplankton production and biomass accumulation. Following the flood, phytoplankton biomass and productivity sharply increased. Analysis of nutrient distributions suggested Escambia Bay phytoplankton alternated between phosphorus limitation during normal flow and nitrogen limitation during low flow periods. This study found that Escambia Bay is a moderately productive estuary, with an average annual integrated phytoplankton production rate of 290 g C m -2 yr-1. {\copyright}2007 Estuarine Research Federation.}

 volume = {472},
 journal = {The Science of the total environment},
 abstract = {Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are two key greenhouse gases. Their global atmospheric budgeting is, however, flout with challenges partly due to lack of adequate field studies determining the source strengths. Knowledge and data limitations exist for subtropical and tropical regions especially in the southern latitudes. Surface water methane and nitrous oxide concentrations were measured in a subtropical estuarine system in the southern latitudes in an extensive field study from 2010 to 2012 and water-air fluxes estimated using models considering the effects of both wind and flow induced turbulence. The estuary was found to be a strong net source of both CH4 and N2O all-year-round. Dissolved N2O concentrations ranged between 9.1 $\pm$ 0.4 to 45.3 $\pm$ 1.3 nM or 135 to 435{\%} of atmospheric saturation level, while CH4 concentrations varied between 31.1 $\pm$ 3.7 to 578.4 $\pm$ 58.8 nM or 1210 to 26,430{\%} of atmospheric saturation level. These results compare well with measurements from tropical estuarine systems. There was strong spatial variability with both CH4 and N2O concentrations increasing upstream the estuary. Strong temporal variability was also observed but there were no clear seasonal patterns. The degree of N2O saturation significantly increased with NOx concentrations (r(2)=0.55). The estimated water-air fluxes varied between 0.1 and 3.4 mg N2O m(-2)d(-1) and 0.3 to 27.9 mg CH4 m(-2)d(-1). Total emissions (CO2-e) were N2O (64{\%}) dominated, highlighting the need for reduced nitrogen inputs into the estuary. Choice of the model(s) for estimation of the gas transfer velocity had a big bearing on the estimated total emissions.}

 abstract = {During the 2001-2002 hydrological cycle, 8,000 tons P year-1 (44{\%} as particulate phosphorus) originating from the Seine basin entered the Seine estuary. P content in suspended sediments (SS) is 2.9 g P kg-1 (80{\%} as inorganic form) at Poses (the upstream limit of the Seine estuary). During the transfer from Poses to Caudebec (the limit of saline water intrusion), Particulate Inorganic Phosphorus (PIP) in SS decreases by 40{\%} whereas Particulate Organic Phosphorus (POP) remains stable. This decrease is explained as the result of (i) a dilution by SS poorer in P, originating from storage zones (mudflats) within the estuary, and (ii) a loss of P by sedimentation, especially in the Rouen harbour where 15{\%} to 20{\%} of SS are yearly trapped and extracted. Downstream, in the turbidity maximum of the estuary, P content in SS is twice as low as at Poses (1.5 g P kg-1, 70{\%} as inorganic form). PIP content is fairly homogeneous both vertically and throughout an annual survey. On the other hand, POP varies by season. Higher POP content is observed during vernal period with phytoplankton accumulation. In a salinity gradient from 0 to 30 (PSS78), PIP content further decreases by 30{\%}. POP does not vary much in this gradient, leading to the assumption that PIP is submitted to desorption in response to the dilution by marine waters (poor in orthophosphates). Using 32P isotopic method, we establish a mathematical formulation of P exchangeable between the suspended solid and water phases of the Seine estuary. Particulate P in the turbidity maximum zone is shown to represent a possible source of dissolved P, available for algal growth in the Seine Bight. Instead of playing a role of nutrient retention, the turbidity maximum zone of the Seine estuary could favour coastal eutrophication. {\copyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.}

Located on the upper Saigon River, Dau Tieng Reservoir plays an important role in economic and social aspects: (1) flood control; (2) domestic and industrial demands; (3) flushing out salt water intrusion from the downstream area; and (4) agriculture irrigation. We propose a reservoir operation model using a constrained genetic algorithm (CGA), in which the fitness function was constrained by penalty functions. The proposed model was formulated by including various water demands configured into the objective function. The penalty functions were designed for various constraints and integrated into the objectives of the operation process to perform the fitness function. The model's performance was simulated for the last 20 years with 1-month intervals and evaluated through a generalized shortage index (GSI). The derived results of three CGA cases with associated environmental flow requirements significantly improved the efficiency and effectiveness of water supply capability to various water demands as compared to current operation. Among the three cases, CGA case 3 achieved much better water releases from the reservoir as indicated by a small derived GSI value (0.33), the smallest shortage of environmental water (0.11 m3/s) and the highest water usage (63.8 {\%}). Thus, the derived results of CGA case 3 were presented as the best rule curves for reservoir operation. To summarize, CGA was demonstrated as an effective and powerful tool for optimal strategy searching for multi-use reservoir operations. {\copyright}2013 Springer Japan.}

 abstract = {Urban form evolution causes hydrologic effects. Therefore, an
understanding of this critical relationship can provide planning and
design solution to make communities more sensitive and resilient to

rapid and uncontrolled urbanization in Ho Chi Minh City on the rise of
Saigon River's water level, none has tried to quantify the urbanization
process at basin-scale and associate this spatial phenomenon with water
upheaval. In addition, the search for a hydrologic-optimal urban form is
critical for Ho Chi Minh City region given the low infiltration rate of
soil and rapid urbanization so that minimizing impervious surface is a
less relevant solution. Response to this research gap and base on
landscape ecology approach, this paper provides an empirical study of
urban form evolution in term of size {[}urbanized area], shape
{[}compactness and fractal] and dispersion {[}aggregation] within 2503

sqkm of Saigon River Basin during a 20-year period of rapid

urbanization. During this period, impervious surface increased by 4 and

8 times in the whole basin and in the flood-prone areas respectively

while the population increased by 2 folds only. Urban development in the

Basin also became less compact, more fractal but more aggregated. Using

5 landscape metrics and a hydrologic index demonstrating run-off

coefficient, the author presents potential relationship between those

form variables and the hydrologic performance of the Basin. The result

of this paper highlights that a more compact and concentrated urban form

for Saigon River Basin may result in lower flood risk for Ho Chi Minh

city.}

Here we present the results of an investigation into the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of particulate and dissolved organic carbon (POC and DOC, respectively) in the Red River Basin. POC concentrations ranged from 0.24 to 5.80~mg~C~L$-$1 and DOC concentrations ranged from 0.26 to 5.39~mg~C~L$-$1. The application of the Seneque/Riverstrahler model to monthly POC and DOC measurements showed that, in general, the model simulations of the temporal variations and spatial distribution of organic carbon (OC) concentration followed the observed trends. They also show the impact of high population densities (up to 994~inhab~km$-$2 in the delta area) on OC inputs in surface runoff from the different land use classes and from urban point sources. A budget of the main fluxes of OC in the whole river network, including diffuse inputs from soil leaching and runoff and point sources from urban centers, as well as algal net primary production and heterotrophic respiration was established using the model results. It shows the predominantly heterotrophic character of the river system and provides an estimate of CO2 emissions from the river of 330~Gg~C~year$-$1. This value is in reasonable agreement with the few available direct measurements of CO2 fluxes in the downstream part of the river network.}

 abstract = {Saigon-Dongnai Rivers in Southern Vietnam is a complex lowland hydrological network of tributaries that is strongly influenced by the tidal cycles. The increasing economic, industrial and domestic developments in and around Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) have led to serious impacts on water quality due to lack of appropriate wastewaters treatment. Drinking water production is impacted and the large aquaculture production areas may also be affected. We analyzed spatial and seasonal variability of nutrient concentrations (Phosphorus, Nitrogen and Silica) and eutrophication indicators (Organic Carbon, Chlorophyll-a and Dissolved Oxygen) based on bi-monthly monitoring during two hydrological cycles (July 2015-December 2017). Four monitoring sites were selected to assess the impact of HCMC: two upstream stations on the Saigon River and Dongnai River branches to provide the reference water quality status before reaching the urbanized area of HCMC; one monitoring station in the city center to highlight Saigon River water quality within the heart of the megacity; the fourth station downstream of the confluence to evaluate the impact of HCMC on the estuarine waters. This study points to excess nutrients in HCMC's water body with concentrations of NH4+ and PO43- averaging to 0.7 $\pm$ 0.6 mgN L-1 and 0.07 $\pm$ 0.06 mgP L-1, respectively in mean over the monitored period and rising up to 3 mgN L-1 and 0.2 mgP L-1, in extreme conditions. During the dry season, we evidenced that untreated domestic discharges leads to degradation of the Saigon River's water quality with extreme values of algal biomass (up 150 \textgreek{m}Chl-a L-1) and hypoxic conditions occurring episodically (DO {\textless} 2 mg L-1) in the heart of the megacity. Until now, eutrophication in the urban center has had no clear effect downstream because eutrophic water mass from the Saigon River is efficiently mixed with the Dongnai River and sea water masses during the successive semi-diurnal tidal cycles.}

These sources are located mainly in the urban and industrial areas of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) and Dong Nai province. The statistical analysis of monitoring data allows us to determine the state of water quality while the modelling approach provides the means to manage the pollution sources. Both approaches are used in this work. Our statistical analysis of the water quality data collected at many stations from the upper reach of the Saigon and Dong Nai rivers to the urban waterways and the lower end of the rivers near the sea shows a contrast of water quality in different basin areas. These differences are consistent in both dry and rainy seasons and during the high tide and low tide. The results show that several hot spots of some water quality variables require management focus, such as organic waste water pollution at Binh Dien and Thay Cai in HCMC mainly due to local sources. Moderately and highly degraded water quality occurs at Binh Phuoc, Phu An and Cat Lai which are downstream from the industrial areas of Binh Duong (Binh Duong province) and Bien Hoa (Dong Nai province) before entering HCMC. Modelling of some important water quality variables also confirms the spatial extent of the areas where water quality is different as analysed from the statistical analysis of monitoring data. The MIKE-11 modelling system is shown to be a valuable tool for predicting the effect of different sources in HCMC metropolitan area on the waterway areas where water quality is important to protect the ecosystem and people health.}

 abstract = {Studying hydrodynamic processes is necessary for understanding the sediment erosion--deposition mechanism in mangrove areas. The hydrodynamic effects within the mangrove area of the Dong Tranh Estuary in the Can Gio Mangrove Biosphere Reserve in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam are very complicated and are caused by the mixed impacts of waves, tides, currents and suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs). In this study, the measurements of hydrodynamics such as waves, currents and SSCs were conducted in the dry (Feb. 2012) and wet (Jun. 2014) seasons. Three stations were set up within the estuary, mud-flat and mangrove forest. The analysed results showed that the hydrodynamics in all three stations were strongly influenced during the first dry monsoon season and the next wet one. The waves were the main factor during the dry season and contributed more SSC turbulence in the mud-flat, potentially causing erosion at the study site. Meanwhile, the current velocities in both the estuary and mud-flat sites were major factors during the wet season. In the mangrove forest, the SSC during the dry season changed due to the tidal cycle. Additionally, two measurements for the change in the topographies and shorelines were conducted from 2014 to 2017. The results show that the study site has been eroding rapidly (0.61 m month $-$1 ). Although this study shows a soil retention role for the mangrove forests, the wave energy dissipation occurs mainly within the mud-flat due to the bottom topography. The study site is proven to be eroding.}

This study focuses on P dynamics because this is considered the key nutrient factor controlling freshwater eutrophication. Based on field measurements and original laboratory experiments, we assessed the P levels in the river water and sediments, and investigated P adsorption/desorption capacity onto suspended sediment (SS) within the salinity gradient observed. Field surveys showed a clear impact of the HCMC megacity on the total P content in SS, which increased threefold at HCMC Center, as compared with the upstream values (0.3--0.8 gP kg$-$1). Downstream, in the mixed estuarine area, the Total P was lower than 0.5 gP kg$-$1. Laboratory experiments were carried out to characterize the influence of SS concentrations (SS = [0.25--0.9] g L$-$1), salinity (S = [2.6--9.3]) and turbulence (G = [22--44] s$-$1) on the sorption capacity of P onto sediment. The size of sediment particles and their propensity to flocculate were also originally measured with a recently developed instrument: the System for the Characterization of Aggregates and Flocs (SCAF{\circledR}). Under the experimental conditions considered, SS concentrations had the greatest effect on the adsorption of P onto sediment, e.g., P adsorption capacity increased when SS concentrations rose. In contrast, salinity and turbulence had a smaller effect on the adsorption properties of sediments. Among these observed variables, the SS concentration was shown to be the main driver for adsorption capacity of P onto SS within the salinity gradient. We discuss the implication of these findings on understanding P dynamics within a highly urbanized, tropical estuary.}

 abstract = {Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC, Vietnam) is one of the fastest growing megacities in the world. In this paper, we attempt to analyse the dynamics of nutrients, suspended sediments, and water discharges in its aquatic systems today and in the future. The work is based on nine sampling sites along the Saigon River and one on the Dongnai River to identify the reference water status upstream from the urban area and the increase in fluxes that occur within the city and its surroundings. For the first time, the calculated fluxes allow drawing up sediment and nutrient budgets at the basin scale and the quantification of total nutrient loading to the estuarine and coastal zones (2012--2016 period). Based on both national Vietnamese and supplementary monitoring programs, we estimated the water, total suspended sediment, and nutrients (Total N, Total P, and dissolved silica: DSi) fluxes at 137 m3 year$-$1, 3,292 $\times$ 103 tonSS year$-$1, 5,323 tonN year$-$1, 450 tonP year$-$1, and 2,734 tonSi year$-$1 for the Saigon River and 1,693 m3 year$-$1, 1,175 $\times$ 103 tonSS year$-$1, 31,030 tonN year$-$1, 1,653 tonP year$-$1, and 31,138 tonSi year$-$1 for the Dongnai River, respectively. Nutrient fluxes provide an indicator of coastal eutrophication potential (indicator of coastal eutrophication potential), using nutrient stoichiometry ratios. Despite an excess of nitrogen and phosphorus over silica, estuarine waters downstream of the megacity are not heavily impacted by HCMC. Finally, we analysed scenarios of future trends (2025--2050) for the nutrient inputs on the basis of expected population growth in HCMC and improvement of wastewater treatment capacity. We observed that without the construction of a large number of additional wastewater treatment plants, the eutrophication problem is likely to worsen. The results are discussed in the context of the wastewater management policy.}

The study was implemented in two sequential steps of (1) bulk examination of groundwater quality followed by principal component analysis/factor analysis (PCA/FA) to apportion pollution sources and (2) pollution source-based examination to assess the effects of anthropogenic activities. Well-water samples were taken in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, in 2015 (233 samples) and 2019 (20 samples) and analyzed for 8 and 15 water quality parameters, respectively. The results showed that 99{\%} of studied wells had pH value lower than the permissible limit, and 29, 20, 15, and 14{\%} of studied wells had concentrations of Fe, NH4+, COD (chemical oxygen demand), and coliform, respectively, higher than the maximum permissible limit. PCA/FA revealed that three pollution sources, ranked in the order of importance: agricultural, urban, and industrial activities, could mainly contribute to enriching the pollutant concentrations of groundwater. While agricultural activities may contaminate groundwater with organic substances, the urban area may enrich bacterial-pathogen density such as E. coli and coliform, and the industrial area may contribute to contaminating groundwater with some inorganic parameters. Groundwater quality index and ANOVA showed that groundwater of the studied area was poor to very poor in quality and that in the agricultural area was the worst of the three land-use types. In brief, the groundwater quality in the studied area was degraded and agricultural activities were the most important factor causing the degradation followed by urban and industrial activities.}

 abstract = {The spatiotemporal variation of phytoplankton and their relationship with environmental variables were analyzed in the Saigon River-a tropical river in Southern Vietnam. Two longitudinal profiles were conducted during dry and rainy season at 18 sampling sites covering more than 60 km long in the river. Besides, a bi-weekly monitoring conducted in the upstream, urban area (Ho Chi Minh City-HCMC), and downstream of Saigon River was organized from December 2016 to November 2017. The major phytoplankton were diatoms (e.g., Cyclotella cf. meneghiniana, Leptocylindrus danicus, Aulacoseira granulata), cyanobacteria (Microcystis spp., Raphidiopsis raciborskii, Pseudanabaena sp.), and euglenoids (Trachelomonas volvocina). Commonly freshwater phytoplankton species and sometimes brackish water species were dominant during the monitoring. Phytoplankton abundances in dry season were much higher than in rainy season ({\textgreater}100 times) which was explained by a shorter riverine water residence time and higher flushing capacity during the dry season. There was a clear separation of phytoplankton abundance between the urban area and the remaining area of Saigon River because of polluted urban emissions of HCMC. Redundancy analysis shows that the environmental variables (TOC, nitrogen, pH, salinity, Mo, Mn) were the driving factors related to the dominance of L. danicus and Cyclotella cf. meneghiniana in the upstream river and urban section of Saigon River. The dominance of cyanobacterium Microcystis spp. in the downstream of Saigon River was related to higher salinity, Mg, Cu concentrations, and lower concentrations of nutrients, Mn, Co, and Mo. The dominance of potentially toxic cyanobacteria in Saigon River possesses health risk to local residents especially upon the increasing temperature context and nutrient loading into the river in the next decades.}

 abstract = {Diversity and productivity of primary producers are known to be influenced simultaneously by resource availability and resource ratio, but the relative importance of these two factors differed among studies and so far only entire phytoplankton communities were investigated which might ignore specific nutrient requirements and stoichiometric plasticity of different functional groups. We measured nutrient availability (DIN, total N [TN], total P [TP]), nutrient imbalance (TN:TP, DIN:TP, N:Pseston), species richness, and abundance of the whole phytoplankton community, as well as those specific for cyanobacteria, diatoms, and dinoflagellates in Cau Hai lagoon in Vietnam. We determined the correlation among these variables, using structural equation modeling. The models applied to the whole phytoplankton community indicated that the nutrient availability (particularly TP and DIN) drove variation in phytoplankton abundance and richness, and that abundance also depended on species richness. The models applied to different functional groups differed considerably from the entire community and among each other, and only a part of the models was significant. The relationship between nutrient availability (mainly TP) and abundance was driven by cyanobacteria, and the relationship between nutrient imbalance (only with N:Pseston) and species richness was driven by diatoms. Remarkably, the positive relationship between species richness and abundance, as consistently observed for the whole phytoplankton community, was only observed for one of the three functional groups (diatoms), indicating that resource complementarity occurs particularly among species of different functional groups. Our results emphasized that nutrient availability (TP and to a lesser extent DIN) as well as nutrient imbalance (albeit only with N:Pseston as proxy) were driving factors for the phytoplankton community in the Cau Hai lagoon and hence alterations in both of these factors leading to a shift in phytoplankton species composition and productivity.}

 abstract = {Nutrient retention was studied in the Danish estuary Randers Fjord, using 2 independent methods: (1) measurement of denitrification and nutrient flux rates across the sediment-water interface, and (2) estimations of mass balance established on the basis of hydrodynamic modelling (MIKE 12). Annual N retention estimated by hydrodynamic modelling was 460 t N yr-1. Direct measurements suggested that 60{\%} of the retained N was denitrified. Despite high area-based denitrification rates (0.1 to 8 mmol N m-2 d-1, or on average 140 kg N ha-1 yr-1) the majority of the N freshwater input (90{\%}) was exported to the open sea, the Kattegat. The model suggested maximum N retention in March and February, and our data indicate that N retention was mainly caused by sedimentation of freshwater allochthonous organic N in the inner part of the estuary. Annual P retention estimated by hydrodynamic modelling was 15 t P yr-1, corresponding to 9 {\%} of the freshwater input. In contrast, flux measurements indicated a net release of 30 t P yr-1. Since the model operates on total P and the flux measurements only included fluxes of PO43-, this significant difference was most probably due to sedimentation of allochthonous organic matter. Simple models used in previous studies of estuarine nutrient retention and denitrification could not explain our data. We tested a model reported in the literature for nitrogen and phosphorus retention as a function of freshwater residence time. Using this model, nitrogen retention was 1.6 times higher than that estimated by our model, while the phosphorus model predicted a 3{\%} release, compared to 9{\%} retention estimated by our model. Models that estimate denitrification from NO3- concentrations in the water column and O2 uptake in the sediment explained less than 7 {\%} of the annual and spatial variations of denitrification in Randers Fjord. Regulation of denitrification seemed to be more complex in Randers Fjord and, consequently, direct measurements or complex modelling will have to be applied to obtain reliable estimates of retention.}

High NO(2)(-) implied some nitrification of a large anthropogenic NH(4)(+) pool. In the lower catchment CH(4) was maximal (6.3+/-4.3 x 10(4)nM), exceeding the ebullition threshold, whereas strong undersaturation of N(2)O and O(2) implied intense denitrification.

An equivalent CO(2) flux approximately 1-10 x 10(10)gy r(-1) derived using global warming potentials is equivalent to total Chennai motor vehicle CO(2) emissions in one month. Studies such as this may inform more effective waste management and future compliance with international emissions agreements.}

 abstract = {The spatial and temporal variations of the flux of CO2 were determined during 2007 in the Recife estuarine system (RES), a tropical estuary that receives anthropogenic loads from one of the most populated and industrialized areas of the Brazilian coast. The RES acts as a source of nutrients (N and P) for coastal waters. The calculated CO2 fluxes indicate that the upstream inputs of CO2 from the rivers are largely responsible for the net annual CO2 emission to the atmosphere of +30 to +48 mmol m-2 day-1, depending on the CO2 exchange calculation used, which mainly occurs during the late austral winter and early summer. The observed inverse relationship between the CO2 flux and the net ecosystem production (NEP) indicates the high heterotrophy of the system (except for the months of November and December). The NEP varies between -33 mmol m-2 day-1 in summer and -246 mmol m-2 day-1 in winter. The pCO2 values were permanently high during the study period (average {\~{}}4,700 $μ$atm) showing a gradient between the inner (12,900 $μ$atm) and lower (389 $μ$atm) sections on a path of approximately 30 km. This reflects a state of permanent pollution in the basin due to the upstream loading of untreated domestic effluents (N/P = 1,367:6 $μ$mol kg-1 and pH = 6.9 in the inner section), resulting in the continuous mineralization of organic material by heterotrophic organisms and thereby increasing the dissolved CO2 in estuarine waters. {\copyright}2013 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.}

Because anthropogenic disturbances often alter the quantity and quality of riverine inputs, this research focused on investigating phytoplankton dynamics in the St. Lucia Estuary, since being reconnected to the Mfolozi River. Due to the closed mouth state of the estuary, the input from the river resulted in oligohaline ($\geq$5) conditions and the characteristic reverse salinity gradient to persist throughout the study (i.e. one year). Model results indicated that phytoplankton communities were structured by rainfall, light transmittance and depth, while shifts between dominant groups were driven by salinity and flow season. The persistence of chlorophytes and euglenophytes as the co-dominant functional group indicates the freshening and nutrient-enriched nature of the river. This study provides the first detailed account documenting the response of the phytoplankton community to recent restoration efforts in the St Lucia Estuary, a Ramsar Site.}

This transformation is mathematically transparent and removes almost all the tidal harmonics, which are present in the original solution. Tidal harmonics make the direct time integration in a Eulerian frame difficult. In contrast, after coordinate transformation, it is straightforward to derive an approximate time- average solute equation through the application of a time-smoothing operator. Using a simple model, it is demonstrated that the transient solute dynamics in the new, oscillating reference frame is a smooth function of time. As a result, the Reynolds rules for time averaging can readily be applied in the new frame and it is shown that the resulting solute equation, which describes the long-term solute dynamics, is indeed a very good approximation to the instantaneous, tidally resolved, mass conservation equation. The practical implementation of the time-smoothing operator is illustrated in the case of a real estuary, the Western Scheldt (Belgium-Netherlands). {\copyright}2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

 abstract = {Cyanobacteria are the most ancient phytoplankton on the planet and form harmful algal blooms in freshwater, estuarine, and marine ecosystems. Recent research suggests that eutrophication and climate change are two processes that may promote the proliferation and expansion of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms. In this review, we specifically examine the relationships between eutrophication, climate change and representative cyanobacterial genera from freshwater (Microcystis, Anabaena, Cylindrospermopsis), estuarine (Nodularia, Aphanizomenon), and marine ecosystems (Lyngbya, Synechococcus, Trichodesmium). Commonalities among cyanobacterial genera include being highly competitive for low concentrations of inorganic P (DIP) and the ability to acquire organic P compounds. Both diazotrophic (= nitrogen (N 2) fixers) and non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria display great flexibility in the N sources they exploit to form blooms. Hence, while some cyanobacterial blooms are associated with eutrophication, several form blooms when concentrations of inorganic N and P are low. Cyanobacteria dominate phytoplankton assemblages under higher temperatures due to both physiological (e.g. more rapid growth) and physical factors (e.g. enhanced stratification), with individual species showing different temperature optima. Significantly less is known regarding how increasing carbon dioxide (CO 2) concentrations will affect cyanobacteria, although some evidence suggests several genera of cyanobacteria are well-suited to bloom under low concentrations of CO 2. While the interactive effects of future eutrophication and climate change on harmful cyanobacterial blooms are complex, much of the current knowledge suggests these processes are likely to enhance the magnitude and frequency of these events. {\copyright}2011 Elsevier B.V.}

The urban canal is subject to severe anthropogenic contamination, owing to poor sewage treatment. In general, water quality in the canal exhibited strong tidal variation, poorer at lower tides and better at higher tides. Some anomalies were observed, with degraded water quality under some high-tide conditions. These were associated with flow from the upstream residential area.

 pages = {76--113},
 volume = {1},
 journal = {TheScientificWorldJournal},
 abstract = {Suspended algae, or phytoplankton, are the prime source of organic matter supporting food webs in freshwater ecosystems. Phytoplankton productivity is reliant on adequate nutrient supplies; however, increasing rates of nutrient supply, much of it manmade, fuels accelerating primary production or eutrophication. An obvious and problematic symptom of eutrophication is rapid growth and accumulations of phytoplankton, leading to discoloration of affected waters. These events are termed blooms. Blooms are a prime agent of water quality deterioration, including foul odors and tastes, deoxygenation of bottom waters (hypoxia and anoxia), toxicity, fish kills, and food web alterations. Toxins produced by blooms can adversely affect animal (including human) health in waters used for recreational and drinking purposes. Numerous freshwater genera within the diverse phyla comprising the phytoplankton are capable of forming blooms; however, the blue-green algae (or cyanobacteria) are the most notorious bloom formers. This is especially true for harmful toxic, surface-dwelling, scum-forming genera (e.g., Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, Nodularia, Microcystis) and some subsurface bloom-formers (Cylindrospermopsis, Oscillatoria) that are adept at exploiting nutrient-enriched conditions. They thrive in highly productive waters by being able to rapidly migrate between radiance-rich surface waters and nutrient-rich bottom waters. Furthermore, many harmful species are tolerant of extreme environmental conditions, including very high light levels, high temperatures, various degrees of desiccation, and periodic nutrient deprivation. Some of the most noxious cyanobacterial bloom genera (e.g., Anabaena, Aphanizomenon, Cylindrospermopsis, Nodularia) are capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen (N2), enabling them to periodically dominate under nitrogen-limited conditions. Cyanobacteria produce a range of organic compounds, including those that are toxic to higher-ranked consumers, from zooplankton to further up the food chain. Both N2- and non-N2-fixing genera participate in mutualistic and symbiotic associations with microorganisms, higher plants, and animals. These associations appear to be of great benefit to their survival and periodic dominance. In this review, we address the ecological impacts and environmental controls of harmful blooms, with an emphasis on the ecology, physiology, and management of cyanobacterial bloom taxa. Combinations of physical, chemical, and biotic features of natural waters function in a synergistic fashion to determine the sensitivity of water bodies. In waters susceptible to blooms, human activities in water- and airsheds have been linked to the extent and magnitudes of blooms. Control and management of cyanobacterial and other phytoplankton blooms invariably includes nutrient input constraints, most often focused on nitrogen (N) and/or phosphorus (P). The types and amount of nutrient input constraints depend on hydrologic, climatic, geographic, and geologic factors, which interact with anthropogenic and natural nutrient input regimes. While single nutrient input constraints may be effective in some water bodies, dual N and P input reductions are usually required for effective long-term control and management of harmful blooms. In some systems where hydrologic manipulations (i.e., plentiful water supplies) are possible, reducing the water residence time by enhanced flushing and artificial mixing (in conjunction with nutrient input constraints) can be particularly effective alternatives. Implications of various management strategies, based on combined ecophysiological and environmental considerations, are discussed.}

 abstract = {Estuaries are among the most productive, resourceful, and dynamic aquatic ecosystems on Earth. Their productive nature is linked to the fact that they process much of the world's riverine and coastal watershed discharge. These watersheds support more than 75{\%} of the human population and are sites of large increases in nutrient loading associated with urban and agricultural expansion. Increased nutrient loading has led to accelerated primary production, or eutrophication; symptoms include increased algal bloom activity (including harmful taxa), accumulation of organic matter, and excessive oxygen consumption (hypoxia and anoxia). While nutrient-enhanced eutrophication is a {\textquotedbl}driver{\textquotedbl} of hypoxia and anoxia, physical-chemical alterations due to climatic events, such as stormwater discharge, flooding, droughts, stagnancy, and elevated temperatures are also involved. The complex interactions of anthropogenic and climatic factors determine the magnitude, duration, and aerial extent of productivity, algal booms, hypoxia, and anoxia. Using the eutrophic Neuse River Estuary (NRE), North Carolina, USA, as a case study, the physical-chemical mechanisms controlling algal bloom and hypoxia dynamics were examined. Because primary production in the NRE and many other estuaries is largely nitrogen (N) limited, emphasis has been placed on reducing N inputs. Both the amounts and chemical forms of N play roles in determining the composition and extent of phytoplankton blooms that supply the bulk of the organic carbon fueling hypoxia. Biomass from bloom organisms that are readily grazed will be readily transferred up the planktonic and benthic food chain, while toxic or inedible blooms frequently promote sedimentary C flux, microbial mineralization, and hence may exacerbate hypoxia potential. From a watershed perspective, nutrient input reductions are the main options for reducing eutrophication. Being able to distinguish the individual and cumulative effects of physical, chemical and biotic controls of phytoplankton productivity and composition is key to understanding, predicting, and ultimately managing eutrophication. Long-term collaborative (University, State, Federal) monitoring, experimental assessments, and modeling of eutrophication dynamics over appropriate spatial and temporal scales is essential for developing realistic, ecologically sound, and cost-effective nutrient management strategies for estuarine and coastal ecosystems impacted by both anthropogenic and climatic perturbations. {\copyright}2005 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {Harmful (toxic, food web altering, hypoxia generating) cyanobacterial algal blooms (CyanoHABs) are proliferating world-wide due to anthropogenic nutrient enrichment, and they represent a serious threat to the use and sustainability of our freshwater resources. Traditionally, phosphorus (P) input reductions have been prescribed to control CyanoHABs, because P limitation is widespread and some CyanoHABs can fix atmospheric nitrogen (N(2)) to satisfy their nitrogen (N) requirements. However, eutrophying systems are increasingly plagued with non N(2) fixing CyanoHABs that are N and P co-limited or even N limited. In many of these systems N loads are increasing faster than P loads. Therefore N and P input constraints are likely needed for long-term CyanoHAB control in such systems. Climatic changes, specifically warming, increased vertical stratification, salinization, and intensification of storms and droughts play additional, interactive roles in modulating CyanoHAB frequency, intensity, geographic distribution and duration. In addition to having to consider reductions in N and P inputs, water quality managers are in dire need of effective tools to break the synergy between nutrient loading and hydrologic regimes made more favorable for CyanoHABs by climate change. The more promising of these tools make affected waters less hospitable for CyanoHABs by 1) altering the hydrology to enhance vertical mixing and/or flushing and 2) decreasing nutrient fluxes from organic rich sediments by physically removing the sediments or capping sediments with clay. Effective future CyanoHAB management approaches must incorporate both N and P loading dynamics within the context of altered thermal and hydrologic regimes associated with climate change.}

 abstract = {Cyanobacteria are the Earth's oldest oxygenic photoautotrophs and have had major impacts on shaping its biosphere. Their long evolutionary history ($\approx$ 3.5 by) has enabled them to adapt to geochemical and climatic changes, and more recently anthropogenic modifications of aquatic environments, including nutrient over-enrichment (eutrophication), water diversions, withdrawals, and salinization. Many cyanobacterial genera exhibit optimal growth rates and bloom potentials at relatively high water temperatures; hence global warming plays a key role in their expansion and persistence. Bloom-forming cyanobacterial taxa can be harmful from environmental, organismal, and human health perspectives by outcompeting beneficial phytoplankton, depleting oxygen upon bloom senescence, and producing a variety of toxic secondary metabolites (e.g., cyanotoxins). How environmental factors impact cyanotoxin production is the subject of ongoing research, but nutrient (N, P and trace metals) supply rates, light, temperature, oxidative stressors, interactions with other biota (bacteria, viruses and animal grazers), and most likely, the combined effects of these factors are all involved. Accordingly, strategies aimed at controlling and mitigating harmful blooms have focused on manipulating these dynamic factors. The applicability and feasibility of various controls and management approaches is discussed for natural waters and drinking water supplies. Strategies based on physical, chemical, and biological manipulations of specific factors show promise; however, a key underlying approach that should be considered in almost all instances is nutrient (both N and P) input reductions; which have been shown to effectively reduce cyanobacterial biomass, and therefore limit health risks and frequencies of hypoxic events.}

Managers now face the additional effects of climate change on watershed hydrologic and nutrient loading dynamics, lake and estuary temperature, mixing regime, internal nutrient dynamics, and other factors. Those changes favor CyanoHABs over other phytoplankton and could influence the efficacy of control measures. Virtually all mitigation strategies are influenced by climate changes, which may require setting new nutrient input reduction targets and establishing nutrient-bloom thresholds for impacted waters. Physical-forcing mitigation techniques, such as flushing and artificial mixing, will need adjustments to deal with the ramifications of climate change.

Climatic change, i.e., warming, more extreme rainfall events, and droughts, act synergistically with human drivers to exacerbate the problem. Bloom mitigation steps, which are the focus of this review, must consider these dynamic interactive factors in order to be successful in the short- and long-term. Furthermore, these steps must be applicable along the freshwater to marine continuum connecting streams, lakes, rivers, estuarine, and coastal waters. There is an array of physical, chemical, and biological approaches, including flushing, mixing, dredging, application of algaecides, precipitating phosphorus, and selective grazing, that may arrest and reduce bloom intensities in the short-term. However, to ensure long term, sustainable success, targeting reductions of both nitrogen and phosphorus inputs should accompany these approaches along the continuum. Lastly, these strategies should accommodate climatic variability and change, which will likely modulate and alter nutrient-bloom thresholds.},

We used the downstream water surface elevation to reflect the tidal constituents of the Yellow Sea when modeling the flow characteristics. We found that reversed flows were repeatedly created and destroyed as the tide varied. The reversed flow affected the spatial variation of the dispersion coefficients and caused the lateral fluctuations of the dispersion coefficient to increase. The change in the flow direction was related to oscillatory variations in the concentration-time curves, and the horizontal recirculation zone at the front of the reversed flow became a storage area where the pollutant cloud was trapped. The concentration-time curves showed oscillatory changes that corresponded with the temporal variations of the flow direction, and the amplitude of the oscillations gradually decreased. The increases in the time for which the polluted water was retained at the riverine parks can be explained by the oscillations on the falling limb of the concentration curves.}

Annual mean net export to the open Baltic Sea was estimated at 39 kt year- 1 for total nitrogen (TN) and 3.1 kt year- 1 for total phosphorus (TP). That means that nearly half of TN and 1/3 of TP loads reported for the Oder River were retained in the estuary. Nutrient retention was greatly diversified in the Oder estuarine system, with its inland part playing a key role; almost 85{\%} of TN retention and 72{\%} of TP retention took place there. Lack of DIP retention pointed to balanced assimilation and regeneration processes. In consequence, net ecosystem production (NEP) was also close to zero. The major sink for nitrogen was denitrification in excess to nitrogen fixation (Den-Nfix). Den-Nfix, estimated on stoichiometric basis, amounted to 25 kt year- 1 and that constituted 70{\%} of the TN retained. Its intensity was four times higher in the inland (ca. 19 g N m- 2 year- 1) than in the marine part of the estuary (ca. 5 g N m- 2 year- 1). {\copyright}2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}

The AOB culture was enriched along with nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) to perform complete nitrification. Batch experiments were conducted with continuous carbon dioxide (CO2) stripping or at controlled IC concentrations. The results revealed a linear relationship between N2O production rate (N2OR) and IC concentration (R(2)~=~0.97) within the IC range studied, suggesting a substantial effect of IC on N2O production by AOB. Similar results were also obtained with an AOB culture treating anaerobic sludge digestion liquor. The fundamental mechanism responsible for this dependency is unclear; however, in agreement with previous studies, it was observed that the ammonia oxidation rate (AOR) was also influenced by the IC concentration, which could be well described by the Monod kinetics. These resulted in an exponential relationship between N2OR and AOR, as previously observed in experiments where AOR was altered by varying dissolved oxygen and ammonia concentrations. It is therefore possible that IC indirectly affected N2OR by causing a change in AOR. The observation in this study indicates that alkalinity (mostly contributed by IC) could be a significant factor influencing N2O production and should be taken into consideration in estimating and mitigating N2O emissions in wastewater treatment systems.}

Coastal waterbodies such as estuaries, bays and lagoons are among those most affected by the ongoing changes in climate. Being located at the land-sea interface, such waterbodies are subjected to the combined changes in the physical-chemical processes of atmosphere, upstream land and coastal waters. Particularly, climate change is expected to alter phytoplankton communities by changing their environmental drivers (especially climate-related), thus exacerbating the symptoms of eutrophication events, such as hypoxia, harmful algal blooms (HAB) and loss of habitat. A better understanding of the links between climate-related drivers and phytoplankton is therefore necessary for projecting climate change impacts on aquatic ecosystems. Here we present the case study of the Zero river basin in Italy, one of the main contributors of freshwater and nutrient to the salt-marsh Palude di Cona, a coastal waterbody belonging to the lagoon of Venice. To project the impacts of climate change on freshwater inputs, nutrient loadings and their effects on the phytoplankton community of the receiving waterbody, we formulated and applied an integrated modelling approach made of: climate simulations derived by coupling a General Circulation Model (GCM) and a Regional Climate Model (RCM) under alternative emission scenarios, the hydrological model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the ecological model AQUATOX. Climate projections point out an increase of precipitations in the winter period and a decrease in the summer months, while temperature shows a significant increase over the whole year. Water discharge and nutrient loads simulated by SWAT show a tendency to increase (decrease) in the winter (summer) period. AQUATOX projects changes in the concentration of nutrients in the salt-marsh Palude di Cona, and variations in the biomass and species of the phytoplankton community.}

Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to investigate the relationship between environmental factors and phytoplankton community. A total of 126 species were recorded with a clear dominance of Bacillariophyceae, which formed about 76.4{\%} of the total phytoplankton counts with an annual average of 44.900 cells/L. Other algal classes like Dinophyceae, Cyanophyceae and Chrysophyceae sustained low counts, forming collectively about 14{\%} of the total abundance of phytoplankton. Although Chaetoceros and Coscinodiscus were the most dominant genera, Schroederella and Skeletonema showed high abundance during the studied period. Among the nine environmental parameters tested in this study, salinity, nitrate and ammonium were found to be significantly different between two seasons. On the other hand, no significant difference was found between stations for the studied variables. Results of CCA indicated that phytoplankton assemblage in the CGMBR was influenced by salinity, nitrate and phosphate concentration. This is the first study simultaneously investigating the phytoplankton communities and their environment in this area and it is essential in order to set up the baseline of future studies.}

This confirmed the potential of the proposed framework for systematically long-term monitoring LULC in Vietnam. Results reveal that despite slight recoveries in 2000 and 2010, the net loss of forests (19,940 km2) mainly transformed to croplands over 30~years. Meanwhile, productive croplands were converted to urban areas, which increased approximately ten times. A threefold increase in aquaculture was a major driver of the wetland loss (1914 km2). The spatial-temporal changes varied, but the most dynamic regions were the western north, the southern centre, and the south. These findings can provide evidence-based information on formulating and implementing coherent land management policies. The explicitly spatio-temporal VLUCDs can be benchmarks for global LULC validation, and utilized for a variety of applications in the research of environmental changes towards the Sustainable Development Goals.}

 title = {Effects of dry-wet cycles on nitrous oxide emissions in freshwater sediments: a synthesis},
 pages = {e10767},
 volume = {9},
 journal = {PeerJ},
 abstract = {Background

Sediments frequently exposed to dry-wet cycles are potential biogeochemical hotspots for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during dry, wet and transitional phases. While the effects of drying and rewetting on carbon fluxes have been studied extensively in terrestrial and aquatic systems, less is known about the effects of dry-wet cycles on N2O emissions from aquatic systems. As a notable part of lotic systems are temporary, and small lentic systems can substantially contribute to GHG emissions, dry-wet cycles in these ecosystems can play a major role on N2O emissions.

Methodology

This study compiles literature focusing on the effects of drying, rewetting, flooding, and water level fluctuations on N2O emissions and related biogeochemical processes in sediments of lentic and lotic ecosystems.

Results

N2O pulses were observed following sediment drying and rewetting events. Moreover, exposed sediments during dry phases can be active spots for N2O emissions. The general mechanisms behind N2O emissions during dry-wet cycles are comparable to those of soils and are mainly related to physical mechanisms and enhanced microbial processing in lotic and lentic systems. Physical processes driving N2O emissions are mainly regulated by water fluctuations in the sediment. The period of enhanced microbial activity is driven by increased nutrient availability. Higher processing rates and N2O fluxes have been mainly observed when nitrification and denitrification are coupled, under conditions largely determined by O2 availability.

Conclusions

The studies evidence the driving role of dry-wet cycles leading to temporarily high N2O emissions in sediments from a wide array of aquatic habitats. Peak fluxes appear to be of short duration, however, their relevance for global emission estimates as well as N2O emissions from dry inland waters has not been quantified. Future research should address the temporal development during drying-rewetting phases in more detail, capturing rapid flux changes at early stages, and further explore the functional impacts of the frequency and intensity of dry-wet cycles.}

Considering data on density, biomass, volume and composition of each size class, we focused on three aspects: i) the contribution of UFP and Pico to total phytoplankton; ii) the responses of UFP and Pico to seasonal variations of selected environmental variables; iii) the identification of the main environmental drivers of UFP and Pico seasonal dynamics. Pico contribution to total phytoplankton density was from 20{\%} to 90{\%}, highlighting the potential importance of Pico also in eutrophic ecosystems. Pico contribution to total phytoplankton biomass was lower, from 9{\%} to 16{\%}. Statistically, temperature resulted the strongest environmental factor controlling both the UFP and Pico seasonal variations in all the studied lagoons. In addition, the role of salinity, water transparency and nutrient concentrations was important in relation to the study site and the size class considered. In this work, the effects of temperature, salinity, transparency and nutrient availability on two different phytoplankton size classes have been described in Mediterranean shallow coastal lagoons for the first time, providing new insight for this ecosystem typology worldwide.}

 abstract = {Studies quantifying the impact of climate change have so far mostly examined atmospheric variables, and few are evaluating the cascade of aquatic impacts that will occur along the land-ocean continuum until the ultimate impacts on coastal eutrophication potential. In this study, a new hydro-biogeochemical modeling chain has been developed, based on the coupling of the generic pyNuts-Riverstrahler biogeochemical model and the GR4J-CEMANEIGE hydrological model, and applied to the Seine River basin (France). Averaged responses of biogeochemical variables to climate-induced hydrological changes were assessed using climate forcing based on 12 projections of precipitation and temperature (BC-CORDEX) for the stabilization (RCP 4.5) and the increasing (RCP 8.5) CO2 emission scenarios. Beyond the amount of nutrients delivered to the sea, we calculated the indicator of coastal eutrophication potential (ICEP). The models run with the RCP4.5 stabilization scenario show low variations in hydrological regimes and water quality, while five of the six models run with the increasing CO2 emissions scenario (RCP8.5) leads to more intense extreme streamflow (i.e., higher maximum flows, lower and longer minimum flows), resulting in the degradation of water quality. For the driest RCP 8.5 projection, median biogeochemical impacts induced by decreasing discharge (until -270 m3 s-1 in average) are mostly located downstream of major wastewater treatment plants. During spring bloom, e.g., in May, the associated higher residence time leads to an increase of phytoplankton biomass (+31{\%} in average), with a simultaneous -23{\%} decrease of silicic acid, followed downstream by a -9{\%} decrease of oxygen. Later during low flow, major increases in nitrate and phosphate concentrations (until +19{\%} and +32{\%} in average) are expected. For all considered scenarios, high ICEP values (above zero) lasted, indicating that coastal eutrophication is not expected to decrease with changing hydrological conditions in the future. Maximum values are even expected to be higher some years. This study deliberately evaluates the impact of modified hydrology on biogeochemistry without considering the simultaneous alteration of water temperatures, in order to disentangle the causes of climate change-induced impact. It will serve as a first comparative step toward a more complete modeling experiment of climate change impacts on aquatic systems.}

 abstract = {The oceans are a major source of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) to the atmosphere. However, little information is available on how estuaries and the coastal ocean may contribute to N2O budgets, and on the drivers of N2O in aquatic environments. This study utilised five time series stations along the freshwater to marine continuum in a sub-tropical estuary in Australia (Coffs Creek, Australia). Each time series station captured N2O, radon (222Rn, a natural submarine groundwater discharge tracer), dissolved nitrogen, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations for a minimum of 25 h. The use of automated time series observations enabled spatial and tidal-scale variability of N2O to be captured. Groundwater was highly enriched in N2O (up to 306 nM) compared to the receiving surface water. Dissolved N2O supersaturation as high as 386{\%} (27.4 nM) was observed in the upstream freshwater and brackish water areas which represented only a small ($\sim$13{\%}) proportion of the total estuary area. A large area of N2O undersaturation (as low as 53{\%} or 3.9 nM) was observed in the mangrove-dominated lower estuary. This undersaturated area likely resulted from N2O consumption due to nitrate/nitrite (NOx) limitation in mangrove sediments subject to shallow porewater exchange. Overall, the estuary was a minor source of N2O to the atmosphere as the lower mangrove-dominated estuary sink of N2O counteracted groundwater-dominated source of N2O in the upper estuary. Average area-weighted N2O fluxes at the water-air interface approached zero (0.2--0.7 \textgreek{m}mol m$-$2 d$-$1, depending on piston velocity model used), and were much lower than nitrogen-rich Northern Hemisphere estuaries that are considered large sources of N2O to the atmosphere. This study revealed a temporally and spatially diverse estuary, with areas of N2O production and consumption related to oxygen and total dissolved nitrogen availability, submarine groundwater discharge, and uptake within mangroves.},

 abstract = {A coupled, fully transient, multicomponent reaction-transport model has been developed to estimate long-term fluxes of reactive compounds in strong tidal estuaries. The model is applied to a preliminary analysis of the carbon cycle in the Scheldt estuary in Belgium and The Netherlands. The model provides a realistic description of the residual circulation in a strong tidal estuary and includes the essential feedback mechanisms between interdependent chemical species. The model has been used to analyze the fundamentally transient nature of strong tidal estuaries and, in particular, the effect of these non-steady state conditions on the long-term fluxes of chemical species out of the estuary. The results indicate that flux estimation techniques based upon steady-state assumptions may result in significant errors. The model has also been used to investigate biogeochemical interactions characterized by a large spectrum of time scales, which it does by including simultaneous equilibrium reactions and kinetically-mediated processes. Simulations carried out with the model suggest that a formulation based upon microbially-mediated, kinetically-controlled reactions provides a superior description of solute profiles in the Scheldt estuary than does a global equilibrium redox formulation. The mixed equilibrium-kinetic formulation also makes it possible to track simultaneously two master variables: the redox state of the system and the pH. By providing strong constraints on the system, these two master variables can be used to test the model's self-consistency. The simulations carded out with the model suggest the pH profile in the Scheldt estuary is the result of a balance of biogeochemical reactions which produce H+ and degassing which consumes H+ and not the result of simple mixing between seawater and freshwater.}

 abstract = {A one-dimensional, time-dependent transport model which includes tidal fluctuations has been developed to simulate the barotropic dynamics and the solute evolution in strong tidal estuaries. The model is used to estimate fluxes in a typical macrotidal estuary, the Scheldt in Belgium and The Netherlands. The results of the model are compared with those obtained with classical flux estimation methods which neglect the nonlinearities of the fluid motion as well as the nonstationary behaviour of solute transport. It is shown that in macrotidal systems, which are generally characterized by fairly long residence times, both contributions are significant. In particular, the residual water flow to the coastal waters differs markedly from the freshwater discharge and the solute dynamics arising from fluctuating conditions at the estuarine boundaries is significantly influenced by the history of the water flow. It is demonstrated that linear property-salinity plots can be obtained in a system characterized by transient (nonsteady-state) conditions. This result allows one to quantify the error associated with the widely used 'apparent zero end-member' (AZE) classical flux estimation methodology. Results demonstrate that the AZE technique, based on the analysis of mixing curves, introduces large errors in the estimation of the long-term residual constituent flux towards the coastal zone.}

Researchers have shown that these algal blooms, which lead to eutrophication of the local water mass, are limited by the supply of inorganic nitrogen from the various bordering estuaries. We demonstrate using the case of a typical heavily polluted macrotidal estuary, the Scheldt in Belgium and the Netherlands, that the short duration of the algal blooms requires estuarine flux estimation methods with a high temporal resolution. We use the fully transient, multicomponent reactive transport model CONTRASTE to compute inorganic nitrogen fluxes through the mouth of the Scheldt estuary into the North Sea. The model simulations use a detailed dataset of upstream river discharges and solute concentrations along with tidal forcings for a 210 day period between December 1, 1994 and June 30, 1995. Our temporally resolved estimate shows that widely used estuarine flux estimation methods which rely on a steady-state approximation underestimate the inorganic nitrogen loading available to sustain primary production in the North Sea during the period of the algal bloom by 100{\%}.}

 abstract = {Estuaries act as strong carbon and nutrient filters and are relevant contributors to the atmospheric CO2 budget. They thus play an important, yet poorly constrained, role for global biogeochemical cycles and climate. This manuscript reviews recent developments in the modelling of estuarine biogeochemical dynamics. The first part provides an overview of the dominant physical and biogeochemical processes that control the transformations and fluxes of carbon and nutrients along the estuarine gradient. It highlights the tight links between estuarine geometry, hydrodynamics and scalar transport, as well as the role of transient and nonlinear dynamics. The most important biogeochemical processes are then discussed in the context of key biogeochemical indicators such as the net ecosystem metabolism (NEM), air-water CO2 fluxes, nutrient-filtering capacities and element budgets. In the second part of the paper, we illustrate, on the basis of local estuarine modelling studies, the power of reaction-transport models (RTMs) in understanding and quantifying estuarine biogeochemical dynamics. We show how a combination of RTM and high-resolution data can help disentangle the complex process interplay, which underlies the estuarine NEM, carbon and nutrient fluxes, and how such approaches can provide integrated assessments of the air-water CO2 fluxes along river-estuary-coastal zone continua. In addition, trends in estuarine biogeochemical dynamics across estuarine geometries and environmental scenario are explored, and the results are discussed in the context of improving the modelling of estuarine carbon and CO2 dynamics at regional and global scales. {\copyright}2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.}

 abstract = {In January 2000, there was a record maximum rainfall throughout much of the watershed of the Swan River estuary. Within three weeks of this rainfall event, a large, mono-specific bloom of the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa had developed in the estuary, with cell counts peaking at over 100,000cellsml-1. A three-dimensional, coupled hydrodynamic- ecological model, ELCOM-CAEDYM, was applied to the period of development and subsequent decline of the bloom. The model, previously calibrated for more typical years (1995 and 1996) when there was no bloom, accurately reproduced the unusual hydrodynamic conditions in the estuary as well as the approximate magnitude and timing of the M. aeruginosa bloom. The model results supported the hypothesis that salinity and temperature are the primary factors controlling the growth of M. aeruginosa during the period of interest. The simulations described in this study show how the model captures the complex interactions between the physical and biogeochemical environment, and indicate the usefulness of the model as a predictive management tool.

 journal = {Estuar. Coast. Shelf Sci.},
 abstract = {An integrated mass balance and modelling approach for analysis of estuarine nutrient fluxes is demonstrated in the Swan River Estuary, a microtidal system with strong hydrological dependence on seasonal river inflows. Mass balance components included estimation of gauged and ungauged inputs to the estuary and losses to the ocean (outflow and tidal exchange). Modelling components included estimation of atmospheric (N fixation, denitrification) and sediment-water column nutrient exchanges. Gross and net denitrification derived using two independent methods were significantly correlated (r2 = 0.49, p {\textless}0.01) with net rates averaging 40{\%} of gross. Annual nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loads from major tributaries were linearly correlated with annual freshwater discharge and were 3-fold higher in wet years than in dry years. Urban drains and groundwater contributed, on average, 26{\%} of N inputs and 19{\%} of P inputs, with higher relative contributions in years of low river discharge. Overall, ungauged inputs accounted for almost 35{\%} of total nitrogen loads. For N, elevated loading in wet years was accompanied by large increases in outflow (7x) and tidal flushing (2x) losses and resulted in overall lower retention efficiency (31{\%}) relative to dry years (70{\%}). For P, tidal flushing losses were similar in wet and dry years, while outflow losses (4-fold higher) were comparable in magnitude to increases in loading. As a result, P retention within the estuary was not substantially affected by inter-annual variation in water and P loading (ca. 50{\%} in all years). Sediment nutrient stores increased in most years (remineralisation efficiency ca. 50{\%}), but sediment nutrient releases were significant and in some circumstances were a net source of nutrients to the water column. {\copyright}2007 Elsevier Ltd.

During March, dissolved methylmercury and inorganic mercury were important factors for determining phytoplankton community composition at most of the stations. In contrast, during July, low salinity phytoplankton community composition was associated with particulate methylmercury concentrations, whereas phytoplankton community composition in the higher salinity stations was more related to dissolved inorganic mercury and dissolved mono and tributyltin concentrations.

 abstract = {The Seine River is a highly artificialised catchment in Europe, comprising both productive agricultural areas and intense industrial and commercial activity. Due to its strategic importance, monitoring programs in the river started as early as the 1970s. The present study compiles and analyses this valuable data set (1970-2014), thoroughly describing the riverine section downstream of Paris and the estuary. We identify long-term trends and shifting patterns in nutrients and oxygen, and pay special attention to the river's evolution after the year 2000, when the European Water Framework Directive came into force. The study has a manifest management perspective, and the results are discussed on the basis of the environmental quality standards proposed in current environmental regulations. The data show that water quality has improved remarkably over the past two decades, with sharp reductions of ammonium and phosphate and a progressive increase of dissolved oxygen levels. The amelioration is prominent in the estuary, where summer anoxic episodes have nearly disappeared. As a result, these three parameters are nowadays in good or very good condition throughout the year. The successful abatement of point sources contrasts, however, with the low effectiveness of the measures provided for the control of nutrients from diffuse sources. Nitrate concentration has increased by 150{\%} since the early 1980s, and only very recently has the upward trend been reversed. Bold agri-environmental management measures are required if we are to prevent chronic pollution problems and truly restore the good ecological status of rivers.},

We used updated bathymetric data and thoroughly calibrated the hydrodynamics and the sedimentary dynamics in the turbidity maximum zone (TMZ). Biogeochemical processes related to oxygen were newly implemented, and freshwater phytoplankton and zooplankton groups were added to the existing marine groups. The simulations allowed us to evaluate the filter effect of the estuary with regard to the main nutrients (N, P, and Si). Today, this filter role appears quite limited and variable depending on the hydrology. On average, considering three different hydrological years, the estuary was able to retain (at least temporarily) 19 kt N yr$-$1, 10 kt Si yr$-$1, and 0.7 kt P yr$-$1, amounting to $-$13{\%}, $-$11{\%}, and $-$27{\%} of the total N, Si, and P inputs, respectively. Seasonal differences in the filtering capacity (lower in winter than in summer) were similar between wet and dry years. Nutrient retention was higher in the upstream fluvial estuary than in the TMZ, the former being mostly characterized by uptake, the latter by remineralization. At the coastal zone, the dry year showed greater risk of eutrophication. Despite lower discharge and lower nutrient fluxes, inputs were confined into a shallower layer, close to the coastline, where nutrients were concentrated and allowed phytoplankton to thrive. Differences in the N : P : Si ratios (lower P-deficit during dry years) could also underpin the larger proliferations, and notably the larger dinoflagellate blooms during dry years.}

To improve the water quality, the restoration of lake by three methods: aeration, phosphorus inactivation using small doses of iron sulphate and magnesium chloride (FeSO4 and MgCl2) and biomanipulation was initiated at the end of 2011. The aim of the present study was to determine whether sustainable restoration has a significant impact on phytoplankton, especially cyanobacterial blooms in a shallow, urban, degraded lake. Therefore, phytoplankton and the physico-chemical parameters of water at the summer thermal stratification and autumn water mixing before (2011) and during restoration (2012-2014) was studied. Samples were collected at the deepest place of the lake in depth profile, every 1~m. Phytoplankton samples were preserved with Lugol's solution. The phytoplankton was counted using a Sedgewick-Rafter chamber with a volume of 0.46~ml. Measurements of water temperature were made in the field with a YSI multiparameter meter, transparency - using a Secchi disk. Concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus and chlorophyll a were analysed in the laboratory according to Polish standards. As a result of restoration the water quality of the lake has improved. Cyanobacteria had almost disappeared during the first year of restoration, however, a short bloom was observed (dominated by Pseudanabeana limnetica) in the second year. The main reason for this reappearance was a higher water temperature stimulating cyanobacteria growth, but an increased supply of phosphorus from the bottom sediments also contributed. A decrease in the temperature in the third year of restoration limited the growth of cyanobacteria again. Although the decrease in the phosphorus concentration as a result of restoration proved to be sufficient for average climatic conditions, it is highly likely to be more intense in the case of increased water temperature caused by global warming.}

 abstract = {The Riverstrahler model describes the biogeochemical functioning of an entire river system, from 100 to 100,000~km2 or more, taking into account the constraints set by the morphology of the drainage network, the meteorological/hydrological conditions, and the inputs of material from point and non-point sources in the watershed. This tool has been applied for research purpose to several river systems differing in terms of hydrological regime and anthropogenic influences. In order to improve its capabilities and its generic dimension, as well as to develop a user-friendly interface allowing its transfer to non-specialist users including managers, the model has been coupled to a GIS interface. This gives the user the possibility to visualize the available geospatial database, to select the best geographical representation of the drainage network, to automatically prepare the corresponding input files required for the model, to pilot the model calculation and to visualize the results. The coupling with a GIS interface has considerably improved the capabilities of the Riverstrahler model. The code of the model is now entirely generic and can be run on any river system for which a suitable database is available. Its spatial resolution can be adapted to the requirement of the relevant problem, from the highest level, where each elementary watershed is individualized, to the lower level, where the whole basin is idealized as one basin with tributaries of each order having the same characteristics. As an illustration of the new potentialities offered by the coupling of Riverstrahler with a GIS through the SENEQUE interface, the results of a same modeling scenario are compared at different spatial resolutions. For the first time, with on-line coupling to a geodatabase, the effect of increasing the spatial resolution of the drainage network representation on the performance of the Riverstrahler model has been examined. At the outlet of the basin, the water quality results were found invariant to a large degree, whatever the details of its representation in the calculations. This result justifies the use of a low resolution representation of the upstream watershed when results are required only at the outlet of the basin. {\copyright}2006 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {The regulatory effect of salinity on nitrogen dynamics in estuarine sediments was investigated in the Randers Fjord estuary, Denmark, using sediment slurries and intact sediment cores and applying 15N-isotope techniques. Sediment was sampled at three representative stations varying in salinity, and all experiments were run at 0‰, 10‰, 20‰, and 30‰. The sediment NH4+ adsorption capacity decreased markedly at all stations when salinity was increased from 0‰ to 10‰; further increase showed little effect. In situ nitrification and denitrification also decreased with increasing salinities, with the most pronounced reduction of approximately 50{\%} being observed when the salinity was raised from 0‰ to 10‰. The salinity-induced reduction in NH4+ adsorption capacity and stimulation of NH4+ efflux has previously been argued to cause a reduction in nitrification activity since the nitrifying bacteria become limited by NH4+ availability at higher salinities. However, using a potential nitrification assay where NH4+ was added in excess, it was demonstrated that potential nitrification activity also decreased with increasing salinity, indicating that the inhibitory salinity effect may also be a physiological effect on the microorganisms. This hypothesis was supported by the finding that denitrification based on NO3- from the Overlying water (D(w)), which is independent of the nitrification process, and hence NH4+ availability, also decreased with increasing salinity. We conclude that changes in salinity have a significant effect on nitrogen dynamics in estuarine sediments, which must be considered when nitrogen transformations are measured and evaluated.}

It investigates three institutional problem areas constituting major constraints to integrated water resources management (IWRM): (a) bureaucratic fragmentation and separatism, (b) top-downism negating multistakeholder participation, and (c) highly centralized administration. It also highlights how the goal of rapid industrialization and economic growth tends to marginalize environmental concerns in policies in water and river management. The authors argue that despite great incompatibilities of the legacy and present features of water-related institutions to IWRM, broader exogenous factors in the country can provide impetus to water institutional changes. These are the currently ongoing reforms of grassroots participation and decentralization as well as the country's enhanced integration and cooperation with the international community, especially with development donor agencies. {\copyright}2009 SAGE Publications.}

 abstract = {We hypothesize that nutrient cycling in a Gulf of Mexico subterranean estuary (STE) is fueled by oxygen and labile organic matter supplied by tidal pumping of seawater into the coastal aquifer. We estimate nutrient production rates using the standard estuarine model and a non-steady-state box model, separate nutrient fluxes associated with fresh and saline submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), and estimate offshore fluxes from radium isotope distributions. The results indicate a large variability in nutrient concentrations over tidal and seasonal time scales. At high tide, nutrient concentrations in shallow beach groundwater were low as a result of dilution caused by seawater recirculation. During ebb tide, the concentrations increased until they reached a maximum just before the next high tide. The dominant form of nitrogen was dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in freshwater, nitrate in brackish waters, and ammonium in saline waters. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) production was two-fold higher in the summer than in the winter, while nitrate and DON production were one order of magnitude higher. Oxic remineralization and denitrification most likely explain these patterns. Even though fresh SGD accounted for only $\sim$5{\%} of total volumetric additions, it was an important pathway of nutrients as a result of biogeochemical inputs in the mixing zone. Fresh SGD transported $\sim$25{\%} of DOC and $\sim$50{\%} of total dissolved nitrogen inputs into the coastal ocean, with the remainder associated with a one-dimensional vertical seawater exchange process. While SGD volumetric inputs are similar seasonally, changes in the biogeochemical conditions of this coastal plain STE led to higher summertime SGD nutrient fluxes (40{\%} higher for DOC and 60{\%} higher for nitrogen in the summer compared to the winter). We suggest that coastal primary production and nutrient dynamics in the STE are linked. {\copyright}2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

 abstract = {In natural waters, the sediment-water interface is the site where gradients in physical, chemical and biological properties are the greatest. Both chemical and microbiological transformation processes are responsible for cycling elements between water and sediments. This paper discusses the various chemical transformations that take place during early diagenesis in sediments, and which are fueled by supply rates of organic carbon and electron acceptors. In particular, our current knowledge of the cycling of the electron acceptors O, N, Mn, Fe and S is assessed, and the important role of transport reactions is described. The elemental fluxes across the sediment-water interface can be described from first principles only if the coupling of physical, chemical and biological processes is better understood. Large gradients in chemical potentials of many chemical species across this interface often lead to steep gradients in proton and electron activities. The redox sequence commonly observed in time and space also leads to changes in the partitioning of solutes between carrier and solution phases. Such processes can cause rapid back-diffusion of released species to the overlying water column or their removal onto secondary carrier phases within the sediments. Physical transport systems such as resuspension or bioturbation of particles control the physical boundary conditions for chemical reactions immediately above or below the sediment-water interface. Because of the complex coupling of the different chemical, physical and biological processes, chemical reactions within this region must be considered an integral part of a three-dimensional network of interactions. Hence, the apparent coexistence of chemical species considered 'incompatible' by thermodynamic models can be a consequence of the three-dimensional nature of redox gradients. The microbiological, chemical and physical interactions of dissolved, colloidal and particulate organic carbon, and iron and manganese oxides play a crucial role in the early diagenetic reactions at the sediment-water interface. Their effects on diagenetic reactions, and on trace elements in solution and adsorbed to particles, are discussed. Furthermore, we emphasize the way in which hydrodynamics can control elemental fluxes in environments with high carbon rain rates. {\copyright}1990.}

Significant variability in isotopic distribution was found over the entire length of the Godavari estuary, suggesting multiple sources of organic matter. The mean isotopic ratios ($δ$ 13C sed -25. 1 $\pm$ 0.9, $δ$ 13C sus -24.9 $\pm$ 1, $δ$ 15N sed 8.0 $\pm$ 2 and $δ$ 15N sus 6.5 $\pm$ 0.9‰) and elemental concentrations (C sed 0.45 $\pm$ 0.2{\%}, C sus 0. 9 $\pm$ 0.7{\%}, N sed 0.07 $\pm$ 0.05{\%} and N sus 0.16 $\pm$ 0.1{\%}) support a predominantly terrigenous source. Significant enrichment in the isotopic ratios of $δ$ 13C from the upper to lower estuary in both suspended (-27.5 and -24.3‰, respectively) and sedimentary (-26.2 and -24.9‰, respectively) phases indicates a decrease in the influence of terrigeneous material toward the mouth of the estuary. A significant positive relationship exists between the $δ$ 13C of suspended and sediment, which indicates that these two organic carbon pools are likely coupled in the form of a significant exchange between the two phases. A positive relationship exists between chlorophyll a and suspended organic matter, which may mean that a significant source of organic carbon is the in situ produced phytoplankton. But, applying a simple mixing model to our isotopes, data yielded about 46{\%} as the contribution of the terrestrial source to suspended matter, which may support the excessive heterotrophic activity in the Godavari estuary reported earlier. {\copyright}2012 The Oceanographic Society of Japan and Springer.}

 abstract = {Can a single line describe tidal damping or amplification? Tidal damping and amplification in alluvial estuaries are constrained by an implicit feedback mechanism. The time lag $ε$ between the occurrence of high water and high water slack is crucial in this regard. An analytical solution of the St. Venant equations appears to result in a surprisingly simple explicit relation for the tidal range, consisting of an exponential and a linear term. In alluvial estuaries, the linear term is dominant, particularly in the case of tidal amplification. In the case of tidal damping the exponential term only becomes important in the upper reaches of the estuary (preventing the expression for the tidal range from becoming negative). In tidal amplification, the exponential term is suppressed by the newly defined tidal Froude Number which (as it contains sin $ε$) tends to zero when the tidal wave gets a predominantly standing wave character. This negative feedback prevents the development of an exponentially increasing tidal range. Finally, the expression obtained is a very useful explicit equation to determine estuary parameters that are difficult to determine from direct observations, such as the roughness and the mean water depth. {\copyright}2001 Elsevier Science B.V.}

The shape of an alluvial estuary is characterised by exponentially varying width and the absence of bottom slope. This topography is closely related to tidal parameters, hydraulic parameters and parameters that describe 1-dimensional mixing and salt intrusion. Starting from the fundamental equations for conservation of mass and momentum, analytical equations are derived that relate the topography to tidal parameters (tidal excursion, phase lag, tidal damping, tidal amplification), wave celerity, lateral and vertical mixing and salt intrusion. The book presents a review of the state of the art, a comprehensive theoretical background and ample case illustrations from all over the world. It provides tools with which human interference in estuary dynamics can be described and predicted, resulting from, for instance: upstream fresh water abstraction, dredging, climate change or sea-level rise. In describing the interactions between tide, topography, water quality and river discharge, it provides useful information for hydraulic engineers, morphologists, ecologists and people concerned with water quality in alluvial estuaries. Although the book can be used as a text book, it is mainly a monograph aimed at graduate students and researchers.}

 abstract = {At the interface between continent and ocean, estuaries receive particles, and especially particulate organic matter (POM) originating from these two reservoirs, but also produce POM, through autochthonous primary production. The origin and composition of surface POM in the Gironde Estuary (SW France) and the environmental forcing of its variability was investigated using the data set produced by the French Coastal Monitoring Network SOMLIT (Service d'Observation en Milieu LITtoral; monthly like sampling during years 2007-2009). This estuary is considered as a model of macrotidal turbid estuaries. Using elemental and isotopic composition of the POM, we estimated that, at the inner estuary space scale and inter-annual time scale, surface particulate organic carbon (POC) was composed of terrestrial POM originated from the turbidity maximum (96.4{\%}; refractory POC) and flood events (1.6{\%}; labile and refractory POC), and of riverine (0.1{\%}), estuarine (0.8{\%}) and marine (1.1{\%}) phytoplankton, i.e. that POC was 98{\%} and 2{\%} of terrestrial and phytoplankton origin, respectively. However, there was a clear spatial gradient: the phytoplankton contribution increases from ca. 1{\%} in the upper and middle estuary to 8.5{\%} in the lower estuary, where light condition is more favourable to plankton growth. The low contribution of phytoplankton to the POC is a characteristic of the Gironde estuary and contrast with other large temperate estuaries. Statistical analysis indicates that salinity, river flow and SPM concentration, and thus associated hydro-dynamic and sedimentary processes, were the only environmental forcings to the composition of surface POC in this system, at intra- and inter-annual time scale. In contrast, temperature and nutrient concentrations, and thus associated processes, do not force this composition of POC.By combining POC fluxes entering the inner estuary (literature data), POC loss as dissolved organic carbon and CO 2 and as sediment trapping within the inner estuary (literature data), and our estimate of the composition of POC flux at the mouth of the estuary (96{\%} and 4{\%} of terrestrial and phytoplankton origin), a first-order net export of POC originating from the Gironde to the continental shelf was estimated: it amounts 48,150tCyr -1, and is composed of 46,200tCyr -1 of terrestrial material and of 1950tCyr -1 of estuarine phytoplankton. POC exported by the Gironde Estuary is thus poorly bioavailable for shelf pelagic and benthic food webs. {\copyright}2011 Elsevier Ltd.}

Reducing nitrogen inputs increasingly favored nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria as a response by the phytoplankton community to extreme seasonal nitrogen limitation. Nitrogen fixation was sufficient to allow biomass to continue to be produced in proportion to phosphorus, and the lake remained highly eutrophic, despite showing indications of extreme nitrogen limitation seasonally. To reduce eutrophication, the focus of management must be on decreasing inputs of phosphorus.}

 abstract = {Sediment re-deposition in mangrove environments is usually attributed to marine and estuarine hydrodynamics - rainfall as a driver was not considered yet. However, combined with annual water level variations, tropical rainfall can play a significant role for sediment re-deposition. Inside mangroves, current velocities induced by rainwater runoff during low tide conditions can be much stronger than tide-induced currents. Along the Saigon River Estuary and the Mekong Delta coastline, rainfall is high from May to October and low from December to April. To study processes controlling sediment re-deposition, data of current and suspended matter concentration have been combined with sediment re-deposition rates. All investigations have been carried out in the Can Gio mangrove reserve, Saigon River mouth. Based on a 19-year data set (1991 - 2009), strong annual variability in water level heights and tidal range are observed, with a mean maximum high tide level of 3.34 m during the rainy season and 3.73 m at the beginning of the dry season. Maximum tidal range is reached during the rainy season coinciding with the lowest annual average sea level. The highest parts of the mangrove forest are not inundated by tides during these periods. Only heavy rainfall during these times can lead to mangrove soil mobilisation, induce strong currents between the mangrove roots and cause erosional gullies. Depending on the amount of precipitation, this sediment mobilisation and the amount of suspension load in the forest can be much stronger than sediment transport induced by tidal currents.}

To assess the extent of nitrification and denitrification in the water column, concentrations and isotopic compositions of ammonium ($δ$15N-NH 4+ ) and nitrate ($δ$15N-NO 3- , $δ$18O-NO 3- ) were measured during summer low-flow conditions along the lower Seine and its estuary. The results indicated that most of the ammonium released from the wastewater treatment plant is nitrified in the lower Seine River and its upper estuary, but there was no evidence for water-column denitrification. In the lower part of the estuary, however, concentration and isotopic data for nitrate were not consistent with simple mixing between riverine and marine nitrate. A significant departure of the nitrate isotopic composition from what would be expected from simple mixing of freshwater and marine nitrates suggested coupled nitrification and denitrification in the water, in spite of the apparent conservative behavior of nitrate. Denitrification rates of approximately 0.02 mg N/L/h were estimated for this part of the estuary. {\copyright}2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.}

 abstract = {The present study was developed for the Patos Lagoon, a coastal lagoon located in southern Brazil. Due to operational limitations, most of water quality studies in Brazilian coastal lagoons are conducted through field sampling at specific stations, providing limited spatial and temporal resolution. Particularly in the Patos Lagoon, studies were conducted through sampling at specific stations at the northern area of the lagoon and/or focusing on its estuarine area. The lagoon has a major importance for the south of Brazil in both environmental and economic aspects, being subject to several human activities, which affect its water quality. Studies indicate that hydrological variations at different spatial scales could affect the Patos Lagoon dynamics, especially those variations resulting from El Ni{\~n}o and La Ni{\~n}a events, promoting wet and dry conditions, respectively. This work presents the spatial and temporal variability of chlorophyll-a and dissolved inorganic nutrients (ammonium, nitrate and phosphate) throughout the Patos Lagoon in two distinct situations: one typical of La Ni{\~n}a event (represented by the 2006 year), and the other, typical of El Ni{\~n}o event (represented by the 2011 year), in order to evaluated if the hydrological variability affects water quality variables throughout the system. Differences between the two situations are concentrated on the main physical forcing, the river flow discharge at the north of the system (Guaiba River) and wind magnitude, being both more intense in 2011 than in 2006. The study was conducted using the MOHID2D numerical model, since it overcomes the field and costs limitations. Results showed that the analyzed concentrations of the main variables were higher in wet condition (2011), with exception of phosphate. The spatial and temporal variations of all water quality variables, however, were similar in both conditions. Thus, different hydrological conditions could affect the magnitude of the concentration of the main water quality variables, but that does not affect significantly its spatial and temporal variability. In addition, it is evident that the numerical modeling application provides a systematic evaluation of a complex coastal system, as the Patos Lagoon, becoming an important tool for its environmental management.},

 abstract = {Ambient exchangeable ammonium concentrations in freshwater sediments are generally considerably greater than those reported for marine sediments. Laboratory measurements indicate that competition for cation exchange sites by ions in seawater is a factor responsible for the lower exchangeable ammonium concentrations in marine sediments. Exchangeable ammonium concentrations were 3- to 6-fold higher when river and estuarine sediments were incubated with fresh water relative to the same sediments incubated with salt water ({\%}.-23). A model was developed to explore the implications for benthic nitrogen cycling of this salinity effect on exchangeable ammonium concentrations. Ammonium diffusion, exchangeable and dissolved ammonium concentrations, and nitrification rates were components of the model formulation. The model output suggests that higher exchangeable ammonium concentrations predicted in fresh water relative to marine sediments can markedly increase the fraction of the ammonium produced in sediments that is nitrified (and subsequently denitrified). These results are consistent with field and experimental laboratory data which indicate that a larger percentage of net ammonium production in aerobic freshwater sediments is nitrified and denitrified (80-100{\%}) relative to marine sediments (40-60{\%}). {\copyright}1991 Estuarine Research Federation.}

It is unclear how climate warming will affect the balance between these processes, particularly among lakes of different trophic status. Here we show that methanogenesis is more sensitive to temperature than methanotrophy, and that eutrophication magnifies this temperature sensitivity. Using laboratory incubations of water and sediment from ten tropical, temperate and subarctic lakes with contrasting trophic states, ranging from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic, we explored the temperature sensitivity of methanogenesis and methanotrophy. We found that both processes presented a higher temperature sensitivity in tropical lakes, followed by temperate, and subarctic lakes; but more importantly, we found that eutrophication triggered a higher temperature sensitivity. A model fed by our empirical data revealed that increasing lake water temperature by 2 °C leads to a net increase in CH4 emissions by 101-183{\%} in hypereutrophic lakes and 47-56{\%} in oligotrophic lakes. We conclude that climate warming will tilt the CH4 balance towards higher lake emission and that this impact will be exacerbated by the eutrophication of the lakes.}

Limitations in model formulation affect the ability to close mass balances, to represent sessile bacteria and other benthic processes, and to achieve robust model calibration.

 abstract = {We use a high resolution, three dimensional, calibrated and coupled hydrodynamic, sediment and biogeochemical model to demonstrate and quantify the nutrient dynamics of an estuary. Observations alone cannot be used to understand estuarine dynamics and the impact of various management scenarios. Calibrated models and model scenarios are useful to provide additional understanding of estuarine systems and can be used to explore and quantify alternative management scenarios. Using the biogeochemical model we identified several management scenarios to demonstrate a range of water quality impacts associated with variation in river flow, sewage and aquaculture nutrient loads and marine flushing. The model was used to inform strategic management of waterways and also gives insight into the biogeochemical and physical dynamics of a temperate salt wedge estuary in South Eastern Australia. A low river flow simulation with high anthropogenic nutrient loads resulted in extension of the estuarine salt wedge upstream due to lower river input. The higher levels of denitrification in this scenario helped to offset increased nutrient fluxes across the marine boundary and the increases in sewage treatment plant and industry loads. However the simulation suggested there would be higher concentrations of nutrients and chlorophyll in the surface layers and lower relative levels of dissolved oxygen in the bottom waters and sediment. The simulation with the lowest loads and with no anthropogenic input resulted in low nutrient concentrations indicating that under these conditions the nutrients are retained and recycled in the estuary. The use of our 3D model allowed greater detail of understanding of the estuary dynamics and loads which is essential for testing the realistic state of future management possibilities when running scenarios. {\copyright}2013.},

After the publication of the first National Coastal Condition Report (USEPA, 2001c), the national water clarity reference value of 10{\%} of ambient surface light at 1 m depth was reevaluated and modified to reflect expected differences in regional reference light conditions. These regional differences range from naturally turbid estuaries like those found in Mississippi and Louisiana to clear water estuaries expected to support extensive beds of submerged aquatic vegetation in, e.g., Florida and Tampa Bays. For the second National Coastal Condition Report, water clarity was assessed based on regional reference values (USEPA, 2004). Different regional water clarity reference values and data collection methods necessitated the development of a water clarity index based on light attenuation coefficients (k). This index incorporates regional reference conditions and is interchangeable with secchi depth and percent light transmission calculated from light meter measurements. Evaluation of the water clarity index shows that k values based on transmissivity at 1 m can be estimated from secchi depth measurements and successfully used as a surrogate for transmissivity calculated from light meter data. An approach for assessing water clarity in Gulf of Mexico estuaries using light meter data and secchi depth is presented.}

This study uses an integrative approach involving multiple benthic and pelagic processes as measures of ecosystem function, and provides a comparison of these processes in three tidal creeks receiving different loads of treated sewage effluent. There were significant differences in process rates between Buffalo Creek (BC) (hypereutrophic), which receives the largest sewage loads; Myrmidon Creek (MC) (oligotrophic-mesotrophic) which receives smaller sewage inputs; and Reference Creek (RC) (oligotrophic) which is comparatively pristine. Benthic nutrient fluxes and denitrification were more than an order of magnitude higher and lower, respectively, in BC and denitrification efficiency (DE) was {\textless}10{\%}. Pelagic primary production rates were also much higher in BC but respiration exceeded primary production resulting in severe drawdown of O 2 concentrations at night. Hypoxic conditions released oxide-bound phosphorus and inhibited coupled nitrification-denitrification, enhancing benthic nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes, leading to a build-up of excess nutrients in the water column. Poor water quality in BC was exacerbated by limited tidal flushing imposed by a narrow meandering channel and sandbar across the mouth. In contrast to BC, the effect of the sewage load in MC was confined to the water column, and the impact was temporary and highly localized. This is attributed to the effective flushing of the sewage plume with each tidal cycle. Denitrification rates in MC and RC were high (up to 6.83 mmol N m -2 day -1) and DE was approximately 90{\%}. This study has identified denitrification, benthic nutrient fluxes and pelagic primary production as the biogeochemical processes most affected by nutrient loading in these tidal creek systems. Physical process play a key role and the combined influence of nutrient loading and poor tidal flushing can have serious consequences for ecosystem functioning. {\copyright}2011 UK Crown.}

 abstract = {Streams and rivers are significant sources of nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4) globally, and watershed management can alter greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from streams. We hypothesized that urban infrastructure significantly alters downstream water quality and contributes to variability in GHG saturation and emissions. We measured gas saturation and estimated emission rates in headwaters of two urban stream networks (Red Run and Dead Run) of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study Long-Term Ecological Research project. We identified four combinations of stormwater and sanitary infrastructure present in these watersheds, including: (1) stream burial, (2) inline stormwater wetlands, (3) riparian/floodplain preservation, and (4) septic systems. We selected two first order catchments in each of these categories and measured GHG concentrations, emissions, and dissolved inorganic and organic carbon (DIC and DOC) and nutrient concentrations biweekly for 1 year. From a water quality perspective, the DOC : NO3- ratio of streamwater was significantly different across infrastructure categories. Multiple linear regressions including DOC : NO3- and other variables (dissolved oxygen, DO; total dissolved nitrogen, TDN; and temperature) explained much of the statistical variation in nitrous oxide (N2O, r2 = 0.78), carbon dioxide (CO2, r2 = 0.78) and methane (CH4, r 2 = 0.50) saturation in stream water. We measured N2O saturation ratios, which were among the highest reported in the literature for streams, ranging from 1.1 to 47 across all sites and dates. N2O saturation ratios were highest in streams draining watersheds with septic systems and strongly correlated with TDN. The CO2 saturation ratio was highly correlated with the N2O saturation ratio across all sites and dates, and the CO2 saturation ratio ranged from 1.1 to 73. CH4 was always supersaturated, with saturation ratios ranging from 3.0 to 2157. Longitudinal surveys extending form headwaters to third-order outlets of Red Run and Dead Run took place in spring and fall. Linear regressions of these data yielded significant negative relationships between each gas with increasing watershed size as well as consistent relationships between solutes (TDN or DOC, and DOC : TDN ratio) and gas saturation. Despite a decline in gas saturation between the headwaters and stream outlet, streams remained saturated with GHGs throughout the drainage network, suggesting that urban streams are continuous sources of CO2, CH4, and N2O. Our results suggest that infrastructure decisions can have significant effects on downstream water quality and greenhouse gases, and watershed management strategies may need to consider coupled impacts on urban water and air quality.}

 abstract = {The autotrophic production and heterotrophic consumption of organic matter in the Westerschelde, a highly turbid and eutrophic estuary in the Southwest Netherlands is examined by means of a dynamic simulation model. The model describes the ecologically relevant processes in thirteen spatial compartments and adequately fits most observed data. Three autotrophic processes are included in the model. Net pelagic photosynthetic production is relatively low (average 41 gC m-2 yr-1) and three spatial compartments near the turbidity maximum zone are respiratory sinks of phytoplankton biomass. According to the model, net phytobenthic primary production is more important than pelagic primary production in the upstream half of the Westerschelde. On the scale of the entire estuary, benthic primary production amounts to about 60{\%} of pelagic primary production. Water-column nitrification, which is very important in the nitrogen cycle, is most pronounced near the turbidity zone where it accounts for the major autotrophic fixation of carbon (up to 27 g C m-2 yr-1). Viewed on the scale of the total estuary, however, the process is not very important. Less than 20{\%} of total organic carbon input to the estuary is primary produced, the remainder is imported from waste discharges and from the river. The degree of heterotrophy of the Westerschelde estuary proved to be one of the highest yet reported. On average 380 g carbon per square metre is net lost per year (range 200-1200 gC m-2 yr-1). The yearly community respiration (bacterial mineralization, respiration of higher trophic levels and sedimentation) is 4 to 35 times (estuarine mean of 6) higher than the net production. This degree of heterotrophy is highest near the turbidity maximum and generally decreases from the freshwater to the seaward boundary. About 75{\%} of all carbon losses can be ascribed to pelagic heterotrophic processes; the sediment is only locally important. Mineralisation rates are highest in the turbidity region, but as only a fraction of total carbon resides here, less than 20{\%} of all organic carbon is lost in this part of the estuary. This result is in contradiction with a previous budget of the estuary, based on data of the early seventies, where more than 80{\%} of all carbon was estimated to be lost in the turbidity zone. Part of this discrepancy is probably caused by changes that have occurred in the estuary since that time. Due to the high heterotrophic activity, nearly all imported and in situ produced carbon is lost in the estuary itself and the Westerschelde is an insignificant source of organic matter to the coastal zone. The model estuary acts as a trap for reactive organic matter, both from the land, from the sea or in situ produced. Internal cycling, mainly in the water column, results in the removal of most of the carbon while the more refractory part is exported to the sea. {\copyright}1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.}

 abstract = {Mutual interaction of water column and sediment processes is either neglected or only crudely approximated in many biogeochemical models. We have reviewed the approaches to couple benthic and pelagic biogeochemical models. It is concluded that they can be classified into a hierarchical set consisting of five levels, differing in the amount of detail given to the sediment processes. The most complex approach (level 4) fully couples water column processes to a vertically resolved biogeochemical sediment model. First simplification is achieved by using a vertically integrated dynamic sediment model (level 3); next is a reflective type of boundary (level 2) where particulate material arriving at the sediment surface is instantaneously transformed into dissolved components. Then comes a set of models in which either the bottom-water concentration of dissolved substances or the sediment-water exchange is imposed (level 1). Finally, in some biogeochemical models, the bottom is plainly ignored (level 0). We have tested these various approaches in a coupled physical-pelagic-benthic biogeochemical model for oxygen, nitrogen and carbon cycling in continental shelf areas. We discuss the various model approaches with respect to their impact on the pelagic system and point out some of the inconsistencies hidden in certain formulations. We conclude that lower boundary types, in which sediment fluxes or concentrations are imposed (level 1), are especially badly designed because they fail to assure conservation of mass. Finally, we suggest as best choice a level 3 approach in which the evolution of sedimentary particulate matter is part of the solution and where the bottom fluxes of dissolved constituents are parameterised based on mass budget considerations. These simplified formulations represent the best balance between computational demand and attained accuracy. {\copyright}2000 Elsevier Science B.V.}

 abstract = {This study investigates the coupling of physical and biological processes in the Northern Adriatic Sea through use of a dynamic mass balance approach derived from an interdisciplinary model of hydrodynamics and water quality. Emphasis is placed on modelling the role of nutrient inputs from the Po River and the response of phytoplankton concentrations and distributions, and basin-wide nutrient fluxes. The effects of riverine inflows, seasonal stratification and meteorological forcing were assessed with a dynamically coupled 3D hydrodynamic (ELCOM) and ecological (CAEDYM) model after validation with in situ field and remote sensing data. Model simulation results and mass balance calculations indicate a close coupling of physical and biological processes over a range of space and time scales. Comparison of fluxes from advection and particulate organic matter sedimentation indicate that nutrient and phytoplankton levels of the Northern Adriatic Sea are sensitive to variations in riverine nutrient loadings. A net total phosphorus accumulation of 4.61 $\times$ 106~kg was determined for the basin in 2002, with different climate scenarios and riverine nutrient loadings resulting in varied system responses reflected in this net TP accumulation. Changes in net accumulation of nutrients are considerably lower than variations in nutrient loadings, which suggests that the Northern Adriatic has substantial buffering capacity. {\copyright}2006 Elsevier B.V.

 abstract = {Seasonal distribution of phytoplankton community and size structure was assessed in three different tropical ecosystems of the western Bay of Bengal viz. estuary (Mahanadi), lagoon (Chilika), and coastal waters (off Gopalpur) in response to ambient hydrobiology. Salinity regimes differentiated the study regions as contrasting ecosystems irrespective of seasons (pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon). Taxonomic account revealed a total no of 175, 65, and 101 phytoplankton species in the estuary, lagoon, and coastal waters, respectively. Prevalence of marine, brackish, and fresh water types in the coastal waters, lagoon, and estuary, respectively, characterized the contrasting nature of the study regions in hosting the phytoplankton community. In general, phytoplankton abundance was observed in increasing order of coastal waters {\textgreater} estuary {\textgreater} lagoon during post-monsoon and pre-monsoon, while lagoon {\textgreater} coastal waters {\textgreater} estuary during monsoon. Bacillariophyta dominated the phytoplankton community in the estuary and coastal waters during all the seasons. In contrast, the lagoon exhibited a diverse array of phytoplankton group such as cyanophyta, dinophyta, and bacillariophyta during monsoon, post-monsoon, and pre-monsoon, respectively. Over the seasons, microphytoplankton emerged as the dominant phytoplankton size class in the coastal waters. Diversely, nanophytoplankton contributed to major fraction of chlorophyll-a concentration in the estuary and lagoon. Interestingly, pre-monsoon dinophyta bloom (causative species: Noctiluca scintillans with cell density 9 $\times$~104~cells·l-1) and monsoon bacillariophyta bloom (causative species: Asterionellopsis glacialis 5.02 $\times$~104~cells·l-1) resulted decline in species diversity. Multivariate statistical analysis deciphered salinity as a major environmental player in determining the distribution, diversity, and composition of phytoplankton communities in the three contrasting environments. Trophic state indices signified the lagoon and estuary as hypereutrophic during all season. The coastal water was marked as highly eutrophic through trophic state index during monsoon and pre-monsoon.}

 abstract = {The fate and cycling of macronutrients introduced into estuaries depend upon a range of interlinked processes. Hydrodynamics and morphology in combination with freshwater inflow control the freshwater flushing time, and the timescale for biogeochemical processes to operate that include microbial activity, particle-dissolved phase interactions, and benthic exchanges. In some systems atmospheric inputs and exchanges with coastal waters can also be important. Climate change will affect nutrient inputs and behaviour through modifications to temperature, wind patterns, the hydrological cycle, and sea level rise. Resulting impacts include: 1) inundation of freshwater systems 2) changes in stratification, flushing times and phytoplankton productivity 3) increased coastal storm activity 4) changes in species and ecosystem function. A combination of continuing high inputs of nutrients through human activity and climate change is anticipated to lead to enhanced eutrophication in the future. The most obvious impacts of increasing global temperature will be in sub-arctic systems where permafrost zones will be reduced in combination with enhanced inputs from glacial systems.Improved process understanding in several key areas including cycling of organic N and P, benthic exchanges, resuspension, impact of bio-irrigation, particle interactions, submarine groundwater discharges, and rates and magnitude of bacterially-driven recycling processes, is needed. Development of high frequency in situ nutrient analysis systems will provide data to improve predictive models that need to incorporate a wider variety of key factors, although the complexity of estuarine systems makes such modelling a challenge. However, overall a more holistic approach is needed to effectively understand, predict and manage the impact of macronutrients on estuaries. {\copyright}2011 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {The Saigon River, Southern Vietnam, crosses one of the most dynamic developing Megacity in Southeast Asia: Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). The increased economic, industrial, and domestic developments may affect the environmental quality of water and halieutic resources. In this study, we evaluated the seasonal (dry and wet seasons) biogeochemical state of the Saigon River during two snapshot campaigns conducted along the river basin upstream from HCMC; the Saigon River was characterized by slightly acidic (pH 5.7--7.7) and oxygen-depleted water (dissolved oxygen (DO), 0.36--5.18~mg~l$-$1). Nutrients (N--NH4~=~0.01--2.41, N--NO3~=~0.14--2.72, and P--PO4~=~{\~{}}0--0.42~mg~l$-$1), DOC (2.2--8.0~mg~l$-$1), POC, and trace metal(oid) (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Zn, and Hg) concentrations were low showing a good quality of the upstream river. In the urban center area, DO dropped to 0.03~mg~l$-$1 accompanied with a rise of nutrient concentrations (e.g., N--NH4, up to 17.7~mg~l$-$1) likely originating from wastewater discharges. Trace metal concentrations also rose sharply (e.g., Cr and Hg rose up to 10-fold higher) in both water and sediments but remained under the World Health Organization (WHO) and Vietnamese concentration guidelines. In the downstream estuarine area, the intrusion of marine waters diluted water flowing from HCMC, leading water quality to return close to the state observed upstream from HCMC. In general, levels of nutrient and metal contaminations along the Saigon River during both seasons appear moderate regarding to Vietnamese and WHO guidelines although the urban area is highlighted as the major contributor for metal(oid) emissions. Finally, we showed that apart from wastewater and industrial discharges that affect the river quality, metal(oid) partitioning between solid and solution is controlled by the change in water geochemistry along the continuum during both seasons, such as DO (e.g., for As and Cr) and pH (e.g., for Pb) which drives their sorption/dissolution dynamics.},

Conversely, zones characterized by shorter residence time (1-14 days) had higher ammonium concentration (13 $\pm$ 5 µM) and lower chlorophyll-a concentration (5 $\pm$ 1 µg L-1) with diatoms making up a larger percent contribution. Longer residence time, however, did not result in the accumulation of large ({\textgreater}5 µm) cells considered important to pelagic food webs. Rather, longer residence time zones had a phytoplankton community comprised primarily of small cells, particularly picocyanobacteria that made up 38 $\pm$ 17{\%} of the chlorophyll-a - nearly double the concentration seen in shorter residence time zones (22 $\pm$ 7{\%} picocyanobacterial of chlorophyll-a). Our results suggest that water residence time in estuaries may have an effect as large or larger than that experimentally demonstrated for light, contaminants, or nutrients.}

Our cruise, conducted in July 2014, consisted of two legs before and after the passing of Typhoon Rammasun, which completely de-stratified the water column. The stratification recovered rapidly, within 1 day after the typhoon. We observed algal blooms in the upper layer of the water column and hypoxia underneath in bottom water during both legs. Repeat sampling at the initial hypoxic station showed severe oxygen depletion down to 30 \textgreek{m}mol kg-1 before the typhoon and a clear drawdown of dissolved oxygen after the typhoon. Based on a three endmember mixing model and the mass balance of dissolved inorganic carbon and its isotopic composition, the \textgreek{d}13C of organic carbon remineralized in the hypoxic zone was -23.2$\pm$1.1 ‰. We estimated that 65$\pm$16{\%} of the oxygen-consuming organic matter was derived from marine sources, and the rest (35$\pm$16 {\%}) was derived from the continent. In contrast to a recently studied hypoxic zone in the East China Sea off the Changjiang Estuary where marine organic matter dominated oxygen consumption, here terrestrial organic matter significantly contributed to the formation and maintenance of hypoxia. How varying amounts of these organic matter sources drive oxygen consumption has important implications for better understanding hypoxia and its mitigation in bottom waters.}

The results showed that Daya Bay could be divided into wet and dry seasons by multivariate statistical analysis. Principal component analysis indicated that temperature, chlorophyll a and nutrients were important components during the wet season (summer and autumn). The salinity and dissolved oxygen were the main environmental factors in the dry season (winter and spring). According to non-metric multidimensional scaling, there was a shift from the large diatoms in the dry season to the smaller line-chain taxa in the wet season with the condition of a high dissolved inorganic nitrogen and nitrogen to phosphorous concentration ratio. Nutrient changes can thus alter the phytoplankton community composition and biomass, especially near the aquaculture farm areas. There was no evidence of an effect of thermal water from the nearby nuclear power plants on the observed changes in phytoplankton community and biomass in 2002.}

To investigate the effects of eutrophication on GHG dynamics, we conducted field measurements every three months from January 2019 to October 2019 in Lake Ulansuhai, a shallow eutrophic lake (mean depth of 0.7~m) located in a semi-arid region in Northern China. We found that Lake Ulansuhai was a predominantly source of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2); however, it converted to a CO2 sink in July due to eutrophication. It was also a strong source of methane (CH4) with a mean CO2 emission of 35.7~$\pm$~12.1~mmol m-2 d-1 and CH4 emission of 5.9~$\pm$~2.9~mmol m-2 d-1. The CO2 concentrations in most sites and CH4 concentrations in all sites were supersaturated, with the average partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) being 654$\pm$34 \textgreek{m}atm and the partial pressure of CH4 (pCH4) being 157$\pm$37 \textgreek{m}atm. The partial pressures and emissions of the greenhouse gases exhibited substantial seasonal and spatial variations. The correlation analysis between the trophic level index and the partial pressure of the greenhouse gases indicated that eutrophication could significantly decrease the CO2 emissions but increase the CH4 emissions from the lake, resulting in a CH4 and CO2 emission ratio of approximately 2 in terms of global warming potential. Eutrophication decreased the pCO2 in the lake and subsequently increased the pCH4 due to nutrient input, thereby enhancing primary production. The results indicated that shallow eutrophic lakes in arid regions are strong sources of CH4 and that eutrophication could alter the greenhouse gas emission patterns.}

 journal = {J. Hydrol.},
 abstract = {Although mangrove forests are efficient natural carbon sinks, most of the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) fixed by its vegetation is believed to be exported via tidal exchange, rather than stored in the vegetative biomass and sediment. However, the magnitude of tidal export is largely unknown because direct measurements are scarce. We deployed a novel experimental design that combined automated high-resolution measurements of hydrodynamic, hydrogeochemical and biogeochemical parameters during the dry season in a mangrove tidal creek in the Can Gio Mangrove Forest in Vietnam. The objective was to quantify the tide-controlled water, porewater, DIC and DOC exchange, and estimate the CO2 evasion throughout tidal cycles contrasted by amplitude. Data from three 25-h time series showed a clear peak of DIC, DOC, pCO2, and 222Rn at low tide, particularly during tidal cycles of large amplitude, which directly relate to porewater discharge. Our mass balance models revealed that the tidal creek was a net exporter of dissolved carbon to coastal waters, with an important contribution (38{\%}) coming from DIC in porewater discharge. Porewater exchange varied from 3.1 $\pm$ 1.6 to 7.1 $\pm$ 2.4 cm day$-$1. DIC exchange ranged from 352 $\pm$ 34 to 678 $\pm$ 79 mmolC m$-$2 day$-$1; DOC exchange, 20.6 $\pm$ 1.9 to 67.7 $\pm$ 7.9 mmol C m$-$2 day$-$1; and CO2 evasion, 69.9 $\pm$ 10.5 to 173.7 $\pm$ 26.1 mmolC m$-$2 day$-$1. These estimates were in the high range of previous carbon assessments and were explained by (i) the monitoring station being located at equal distance from the head and the mouth of the creek, which minimized carbon degradation and losses associated to transport in water; and (ii) the site being a highly productive mangrove within South East Asia.}

 abstract = {Constraining the contribution of mangrove-derived carbon in tidal creeks is fundamental to understanding the fate of mangrove primary production and the role of mangroves as coastal carbon sinks. Porewater measurements and 24-h time series in a mangrove tidal creek were conducted during the dry and wet season, and over contrasting tidal ranges at the Can Gio Biosphere Reserve, Vietnam. Surface water carbon concentrations (dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2)) and their respective $δ$13C values were correlated with radon, suggesting that porewater input drives mangrove-derived carbon in the tidal creek. Based on three complementary mixing models, porewater input contributed to about 30{\%} of the water volume and 46{\%} to 100{\%} of DOC and DIC pools in the tidal creek at low tide, with variabilities between seasons and tidal amplitudes. The creek carbon pool was 88{\%} DIC, 6{\%} DOC, and 6{\%} particulate organic carbon (POC). The pCO2 values during the wet season (2973--16,495 $μ$atm) were on average 5-fold higher than during the dry season (584--2946 $μ$atm). This was explained by a potential greater mineralization attributed to higher organic matter availability and residual humidity that stimulate bacterial activity, and by a potential tidal dilution changing the pCO2/DIC ratio as suggested by the Revelle factor. Consequently, average CO2 evasion from the creek was estimated at 327--427 mmolC m$-$2 d$-$1 during the wet season and 92--213 mmolC m$-$2 d$-$1 during the dry season, using two independent approaches. Tidal amplitude seemed to influence porewater input and its carbon loads, with a higher contribution during frequent and high tidal amplitudes (symmetric). However, the highest input occurred in a tidal cycle which was preceded by tidal cycle of low amplitude (asymmetric). We explain this ambiguity by the influence of both, rapid water turnover intensifying porewater exchange, and long water residence time enhancing carbon load in porewater.}

 abstract = {The importance of mangrove-derived material in sustaining coastal food webs (i.e. the Outwelling Hypothesis) is often invoked in support of mangroves conservation. Biogeochemical cycling, particularly nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in mangrove ecosystems, however, is poorly understood because of high spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability of sources, sinks, and transformation pathways. Here we show that the distribution of N and P are intimately related to vegetation distribution, tidal cycles, and seasonality. We examined the dynamics of N and P in sediments and in a tidal creek of the Can Gio Mangrove Forest, Vietnam. Our objectives were to (1) determine the spatial distribution of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus in the mangrove forest along a Rhizophora-Avicennia-mudflat transect; and (2) identify the respective inputs and transformation pathways of N and P in the water column via 24-h time series measurements in a tidal creek. Sediment porewater had N-NH4+ and N-NO3$-$ concentrations {\textless}11 $μ$M, except in the mudflat where N-NH4+ was as high as 162 $μ$M. This difference was likely due to N-NH4+ uptake by trees in the vegetated areas and suggests that mangrove sediments can be a zone of NH4+ production via ammonification of organic nitrogen. In all stands, P-PO43$-$ concentrations were three-fold higher during the wet season, with a maximum of 34.4 $μ$M. This can be explained by enhanced microbial activity during the rainy season. The phosphorus seasonal trend was also observed in the creek water but with a maximum P-PO43$-$ value of 4.3 $μ$M only. In the tidal creek, N-NH4+ was highly variable (0 to 51 $μ$M), with the higher values measured at low tide and related to porewater discharge from the mudflat. Our data suggest that mangroves act both as a sink of dissolved inorganic nutrients via vegetation uptake and a source of ammonium from unvegetated mudflat porewater towards the tidal creek. The dual stable isotopes approach ($δ$15NNO3 {\&} $δ$18ONO3) revealed that this ammonium was later nitrified within the water column. Moreover, the approach showed that some nitrate originated from the river-estuarine system during rising tides. The export of ammonium from mangrove porewater is presumably entirely consumed before exiting the tidal creek, thereby limiting the spatial extent of mangrove Outwelling. Nevertheless, our multi-isotope approach leads us to conclude that nutrients recycling via mangrove-derived organic matter mineralization may play a fundamental role in sustaining coastal food web.}

 number = {6},
 journal = {Estuar. Coast. Shelf Sci.},
 abstract = {In a number of regions of the world, enhanced flows of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from land to sea are of major concern because of the observable deterioration in the quality of many nearshore marine waters. Estuaries receive N and P from river and other runoff, from waste discharges, from the atmosphere and ocean and from exchange with coastal groundwaters (which in all likelihood results in a net input to the estuary). For rivers that do not discharge directly onto the continental shelf, seaward fluxes of N and P will be modified by within-estuary transformations of reactive species, the burial of particulate N and P in sediments (sub/intertidal, saltmarsh, mangrove) and the loss of gaseous N and P species by bacterial reduction. Driven by a desire to understand the effects of changing N and P loads on water quality, and to gain insights into the true modification of their fluxes within estuaries, much effort has been expended on providing quantitative estimates of the sources and sinks of these constituents. Yet, accurate and precise estimates on a global scale remain elusive. Riverine inputs of total N and P are calculated to be 35-64 and 22 Mt a-1, respectively. These inputs are dominated by particulate species, and because of this, are likely to be imprecise as overall sediment fluxes are disproportionately influenced by infrequent, poorly sampled, high flow events. Direct aeolian inputs of N to estuaries (P inputs are minor), at a minimum of 1-4 Mt a-1, are small but significant, although again good estimates are hampered by the apparent importance of infrequent, and thus under-sampled, deposition events. Indirect atmospheric inputs via deposition onto and runoff from catchments may be highly significant, at least in environments bounding the North Atlantic Ocean. Groundwater inputs are generally unknown, but, for N, may be 5-10 Mt a-1 (no data on P). Information on the global inputs of N and P from waste discharges and mariculture do not appear to be available. Denitrification, estimated to be ca. 33 Mt a-1, may account for 52-94{\%} of the currently estimated total N inputs; in contrast, the loss of P via venting of gaseous phosphine is unknown. The burial of N and P in sediments is about 7{\%} and 30{\%} of their total inputs, respectively. Nevertheless, reliable information on the modifying role of estuarine sediments appears far from complete. Globally, the inputs of N and P to the marine environment from all sources are expected to increase over the next few decades. The resulting effects of these increases on the marine environment, including any influences due to estuarine processing, may be partly assessed through the use of dynamic transport and transformation estuarine models for N and P. A further important development in this respect will be the linking of complementary models (e.g. catchment/river/estuarine/coastal zone) and their coupling to strategic large scale observations. {\copyright}2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

 abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein$-$protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-\textgreek{a}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD $\leq$ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.}

 abstract = {Receiving coastal waters and estuaries are among the most nutrient-enriched environments on earth, and one of the symptoms of the resulting eutrophication is the proliferation of opportunistic, fast-growing marine seaweeds. Here, we used a widespread macroalga often involved in blooms, Ulva spp., to investigate how supply of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), the two main potential growth-limiting nutrients, influence macroalgal growth in temperate and tropical coastal waters ranging from low- to high-nutrient supplies. We carried out N and P enrichment field experiments on Ulva spp. in seven coastal systems, with one of these systems represented by three different subestuaries, for a total of nine sites. We showed that rate of growth of Ulva spp. was directly correlated to annual dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations, where growth increased with increasing DIN concentration. Internal N pools of macroalgal fronds were also linked to increased DIN supply, and algal growth rates were tightly coupled to these internal N pools. The increases in DIN appeared to be related to greater inputs of wastewater to these coastal waters as indicated by high $δ$15N signatures of the algae as DIN increased. N and P enrichment experiments showed that rate of macroalgal growth was controlled by supply of DIN where ambient DIN concentrations were low, and by P where DIN concentrations were higher, regardless of latitude or geographic setting. These results suggest that understanding the basis for macroalgal blooms, and management of these harmful phenomena, will require information as to nutrient sources, and actions to reduce supply of N and P in coastal waters concerned. {\copyright}2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.}

 abstract = {Mangroves can be considered as biogeochemical reactors along (sub)tropical coastlines, acting both as sinks or sources for trace metals depending on environmental factors. In this study, we characterized the role of a mangrove estuary, developing downstream a densely populated megacity (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam), on the fate and partitioning of trace metals. Surface water and suspended particulate matter were collected at four sites along the estuarine salinity gradient during 24 h cycling in dry and rainy seasons. Salinity, pH, DO, TSS, POC, DOC, dissolved and particulate Fe, Mn, Cr, As, Cu, Ni, Co and Pb were measured. TSS was the main trace metals carrier during their transit in the estuary. However, TSS variations did not explain the whole variability of metals distribution. Mn, Cr and As were highly reactive metals while the other metals (Fe, Ni, Cu, Co and Pb) presented stable log KD values along the estuary. Organic matter dynamic appeared to play a key role in metals fractioning. Its decomposition during water transit in the estuary induced metal desorption, especially for Cr and As. Conversely, dissolved Mn concentrations decreased along the estuary, which was suggested to result from Mn oxidative precipitation onto solid phase due to oxidation and pH changes. Extra sources as pore-water release, runoff from adjacent soils, or aquaculture effluents were suggested to be involved in trace metal dynamic in this estuary. In addition, the monsoon increased metal loads, notably dissolved and particulate Fe, Cr, Ni and Pb.}

A sea dike to close Can Gio Bay has been proposed to regulate storage and control water levels in the drainage and sewer system of Ho Chi Minh City. However, this proposed sea dike and different gate operating modes could significantly change the hydrodynamic regime in Can Gio Bay. In this study, a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model was developed to assess changes in the hydrodynamic regime after construction of the sea dike, including fluctuations in the inundated areas in Can Gio Bay mangrove forests. The results show that sea dike construction is an effective solution for controlling water levels and reducing inundation, especially considering a sea level rise scenario in the year 2050. Further, the gate operation mode also affects the effectiveness of inundation reduction, which is approximately 10{\%} better than the same sea dike type without gate operation. However, the sea dike was less effective in a sea water level rise scenario in 2100 for all scenarios.}

In order to resolve this question we have developed a coupled 3D hydrodynamic-ecological model with numerical nitrogen tracking for Horsens estuary, which is a typical Danish estuary that is shallow and well ventilated with water from the adjacent open sea. The nitrogen tracking technique revealed that nitrogen discharges from local streams accounted for the major part (40{\%}-90{\%}) of the nitrogen in NO3, NH4 and detritus whereas only 15{\%} to 50{\%} of the nitrogen in phytoplankton originated from streams. Effects of nitrogen loading reductions were most pronounced for nutrient concentrations and Chl a concentrations whereas the light condition was only slightly improved. The impact of stream nitrogen reductions on nitrate concentrations, Chl a concentrations and light attenuation was respectively 7, 2 and 3 times higher than the impact of open sea nitrogen reductions. Hence, even in estuaries that are well ventilated with water from the adjacent sea significant environmental improvements can be expected after reduction in local nutrient discharges. {\copyright}2010 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Most coastal areas globally face water shortages in the dry season due to salinization and drought. The Mekong River Delta (MRD) is recognized as the ``Rice Bowl'' in Vietnam but the negative effects of salinization and drought have damaged rice production in recent decades. However, regional assessment of the perturbation has been lacking. A Landsat-based satellite salinity index, the Enhanced Salinity Index (ESI), was developed in this study to explore patterns of annual salinity variations in agricultural land and their relationship to drought in the MRD from 1989 to 2018. The performance of the index was superior to that of other previously published remotely sensed indices, based on correlations with field measurements of electrical conductivity (i.e. groundwater and soil EC), which can be used as a proxy for salinity. The time-series ESI was then utilized to explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of salinity in the study area using the Theil-Send median trend (TS) and Mann-Kendall significance tests (MK). In addition, temporal relationships with the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) were used to investigate the relationship between drought and saline intrusion. Our results showed that freshwater and brackish areas increased inland, whereas those developed for shrimp farming may increase soil and groundwater salinity. A negative correlation between drought and salinity was also observed in surface water where fish and shrimp farming activities took place, while a positive relationship was discovered in rice and annual cropland areas. This study highlights the use of ESI as an effective parameter for modelling vegetation salinity and its relationship with cropland change. We also demonstrate the feasibility of integrating satellite imagery with spatiotemporal analyses to monitor and assess regional salinization dynamics.}

 abstract = {The present study focuses on the long-term multi-year evolution of the shoreline position of the Nha Trang sandy beach. To this end an empirical model which is a combination of longshore and cross-shore models, is used. The Nha Trang beach morphology is driven by a tropical wave climate dominated by seasonal variations and winter monsoon intra-seasonal pulses. The combined model accounts for seasonal shoreline evolution, which is primarily attributed to cross-shore dynamics but fails to represent accretion that occurs during the height of summer under low energy conditions. The reason is in the single equilibrium Dean number eq of the ShoreFor model, one of the components of the combined model. This equilibrium Dean number cannot simultaneously account for the evolution of strong intra-seasonal events (i.e., winter monsoon pulses) and the annual recovery mechanisms associated with swash transport. By assigning a constant value to eq, when the surf similarity parameter is higher than 3.3 (occurrence of small surging breakers in summer), we strongly improve the shoreline position prediction. This clearly points to the relevance of a multi-scale approach, although our modified eq retains the advantage of simplicity.}

MOHID water quality model is driven by a physical transport model and simulates the dynamics and productivity of the two main primary producers (phytoplankton and macroalgae) as well as the cycling of nitrogen, carbon and oxygen in interaction with sediment and hydrodynamics. The integrated model is forced by exchanges with the Atlantic Ocean (tide), atmosphere, and by sediment and nutrient inputs from the upstream rivers and other discharges. Focus is given to the light parameterization of primary production, influence of hydro and sediment dynamics and to the prediction of seaweed beds distribution. The results obtained show that the model is better adjusted to field data with macroalgae's simulation and that macroalgae can have an important role in primary production. Hydrodynamic conditions can be significant in the competition between the two primary producers, determining the predominant groups as well as their limiting factors. {\copyright}2005 Elsevier B.V.

Experimental data from three areas of different water and sediment quality, combined with some additional data from the river, are used to set up and calibrate a diagenetic model. The model was used to determine the role of the sediments as a sink for carbon and nutrients and shows that in the dry season, 27{\%} of nitrogen, 25{\%} of carbon, and 38{\%} of phosphorus inputs into the river system are stored in sediments. The corresponding numbers during the rainy season are 15{\%}, 10{\%}, and 20{\%}, respectively. The diagenetic model was then used to test the impact of an improvement in the treatment of Hanoi's municipal wastewater. We show that improved wastewater treatment could reduce by about 17.5{\%} the load of organic matter to the sediment. These results are the first to highlight the importance of sediments as a potential removal mechanism of organic matter and nutrients from the water column in this type of highly impacted tropical urban river, further demonstrating that rivers need to be considered as reaction sites and not just as inert conduits. {\copyright}2012.

To accommodate the increasing population, the megacity now stretches out in an urban continuum covering more than 800 square kilometers and is currently growing at a rate of 3.2{\%} per year. If the neighboring provinces around HCMC are included, the total population reaches nearly 18 million people. This paper attempts to describe the interplay between HCMC and flood-related risks and offer some guidelines to deal with inundations. The potential risks of flooding by rain, tsunami and/or dam failure upstream of the city are evaluated and contextualized within the perspective of climate and human-induced environmental changes. The region is highly vulnerable to the combined effects of subsidence and rising sea levels and has already led to serious flooding that may extend spatially before the end of the century. We propose possible preventative solutions to urban flooding using a multi-pronged approach to issues regarding urban development and suggest a redevelopment strategy for major infrastructure projects.}

Salinity, turbidity, and inorganic nutrient concentrations and their respective ratios have all been proposed as principal factors that structure phytoplankton diversity and influence the emergence of potentially toxic species. Although much work has been conducted on temperate estuaries, less is known about how phytoplankton diversity is controlled in tropical, monsoonal systems that are subject to large, seasonal shifts in hydrology and to rapidly changing land use. Here, we present the results of an investigation into the factors controlling phytoplankton species composition and distribution in a tropical, monsoonal estuary (Bach Dang estuary, North Vietnam). A total of 245 taxa, 89 genera from six algal divisions were observed. Bacillariophyceae were the most diverse group contributing to 51.4~{\%} of the microalgal assemblage, followed by Dinophyceae (29.8~{\%}), Chlorophyceae (10.2~{\%}), Cyanophyceae (3.7~{\%}), Euglenophyceae (3.7~{\%}) and Dictyochophyceae (1.2~{\%}). The phytoplankton community was structured by inorganic nutrient ratios (DSi:DIP and DIN:DIP) as well as by salinity and turbidity. Evidence of a decrease in phytoplankton diversity concomitant with an increase in abundance and dominance of certain species (e.g., Skeletonema costatum) and the appearance of some potentially toxic species over the last two decades was also found. These changes in phytoplankton diversity are probably due to a combination of land use change resulting in changes in nutrient ratios and concentrations and global change as both rainfall and temperature have increased over the last two decades. It is therefore probable in the future that phytoplankton diversity will continue to change, potentially favoring the emergence of toxic species in this system.}

 abstract = {A fully coupled, two-dimensional hydrodynamic and reactive-transport model of C, N, O2 and Si along a river-estuarine-coastal zone system is presented. It is applied to the Scheldt continuum, a macrotidal environment strongly affected by anthropogenic perturbations. The model extends from the upper tidal river and its tributaries to the southern Bight of the North Sea. Five dynamically linked nested grids are used, with a spatial resolution progressively increasing from 33~m to 2.7~km. The biogeochemical reaction network consists of aerobic degradation, nitrification, denitrification, phytoplankton growth and mortality, as well as reaeration. Diagnostic simulations of a typical summer situation in the early 1990s are compared to field data taken from the OMES database ({\textgreater}300 samples per variable). Results demonstrate that the process rates in the tidal river are very high and far larger than in the saline estuary, with maximum nitrification rates in the water column up to 70~mM N day- 1, and maximum aerobic respiration and denitrification up to 70 and 40~mM C day- 1, respectively. Phytoplankton production is about one order of magnitude lower, a result which confirms the dominance of heterotrophic processes in this system. The influence of secondary and tertiary wastewater treatment in the catchment is then assessed. Results show a significant decrease of organic matter and ammonium concentrations above Antwerp, which in turn leads to a partial restoration of oxygen levels. The model also predicts a reduction of denitrification rates, which locally results in a 4-fold increase of the nitrate concentration. Mass budgets for carbon, nitrogen and oxygen are established for the saline estuary (km 0 to 100) and for the tidal river network (km 100 to 160). Three scenarios, corresponding to the situation in the early 1990s, the years 2000 and the situation expected in 2010 are considered. They show that the tidal river and the estuary contribute almost equally to the overall biogeochemical cycling of these elements, despite the very different water volumes involved. For the simulated periods, the large decrease in nitrogen input ({\textgreater}55{\%}) expected between 1990 and 2010 will not lead to a significant decrease of N export to the coastal zone during the summer period. {\copyright}2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the sustainability of integrated water resources management in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) was evaluated using the City Blueprint approach. The City Blueprint is a set of 24 dedicated indicators divided over 8 categories (i.e., water security, water quality, drinking water, sanitation, infrastructure, climate robustness, biodiversity and attractiveness, and governance including public participation). The analysis showed that the rapid increase of water use for urban, industrial, and agricultural activities in HCMC has resulted in depletion of groundwater and severe pollution of both groundwater and surface water. Surface water quality, groundwater quality, biodiversity, and the sanitation of domestic and industrial wastewater are matters that need serious improvement. Current and future water supply in HCMC is at risk. HCMC can cope with it, but the 7 governance gaps as described by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are major obstacles for HCMC. Rainwater harvesting, pollution reduction, as well as wastewater reuse are among the practical options. Wastewater reuse could lower the water stress index to 10{\%}. The window to do this is narrow and rapidly closing as a result of the unprecedented urbanization and economic growth of this region.}

 abstract = {Within the framework of tidally flushed, semi-enclosed basins with negligible freshwater inflow, and under steady periodic flow conditions, three frequently used local transport time scales to quantify the efficiency of water renewal, namely water age, exposure time, and local flushing time are studied and compared to each other. In these environments, water renewal is strongly controlled by diffusion, and it is significantly affected by the return flow (i.e., the fraction of effluent water that returns into the basin on each flood tide). The definition of water age is here modified to account for the return flow, in analogy with exposure time and local flushing time. We consider approximate time scales, whose accuracy is analyzed, in order to overcome problems related to the size of the computational domain and to reduce the computational effort. A new approximate procedure is introduced to estimate water age, which is based on the water aging rate. Also, the concept of local flushing time as a relevant time scale is introduced. Under steady periodic conditions, we demonstrate that the local flushing time quantitatively corresponds to water age, and well approximates exposure time when the flow is dominated by diffusion. Since the effort required to compute water age and exposure time is greater than that required to compute the local flushing time, the present results can also have a practical interest in the assessment of water renewal efficiency of semi-enclosed water basins. The results of a modeling study, in which the lagoon of Venice is used as a benchmark, confirm the substantial quantitative equivalence between these three transport time scales in highly diffusive environments.}

The impact of hydro-sedimentary processes on SRP concentrations and fluxes is estimated under various hydrological conditions. Sorption interaction parameters between SRP and suspended matter are experimentally determined on river water samples and are included in a hydro-ecological model. Simulated concentrations are compared to weekly measurements at 11 monitoring stations. The introduction of sorption in the model reduces the root mean square error of simulated SRP concentrations by 20~{\%} and allows the simulation of particulate inorganic P (PIP) accumulation in the system. With these ameliorations, the model constitutes a reliable management tool, which is compatible with the requirements of new regulations as the European Water Framework Directive. P mass balances are assessed upstream and downstream the major waste water treatment plant of the Paris urban area. P fluxes in the system are mainly driven by hydrological conditions and sediment-related processes. While SRP is the predominant P form during low flow, PIP accounts for more than 70~{\%} of the total P during high flow. Moreover, SRP sorption fluxes are of the same order of magnitude as biotic fluxes affecting SRP concentrations. According to the model, and based on all the available data, 75~{\%} of the SRP release by the river bed sediments occurs during high flow periods, and PIP exchanges at the sediment--water interface are more than 4 times higher during high flow periods than during low flow periods.}

The Seine River, from the Paris urban area to the entrance of its estuary (220 km), is studied here as an example of a large human-impacted river system subject to temperate climatic conditions. We assess organic C (OC) budgets upstream and downstream from one of the world's largest wastewater treatment plants and for different hydrological conditions using a hydrobiogeochemical model. The fine representation of sediment accumulation on the river bed allows for the quantification of pelagic and benthic effects on OC export toward the estuary and on river metabolism (i.e., net CO2 production). OC export is significantly affected by benthic dynamics during the driest periods, when 25{\%} of the inputs to the system is transformed or stored in the sediment layer. Benthic processes also substantially affect river metabolism under any hydrological condition. On average, benthic respiration accounts for one third of the total river respiration along the studied stretch (0.27 out of 0.86 g C m$-$2 d$-$1). Even though the importance of benthic processes was already acknowledged by the scientific community for headwater streams, these results stress the major influence of benthic dynamics, and thus of physical processes such as sedimentation and resuspension, on C cycling in downstream river systems. It opens the door to new developments in the quantification of C emissions by global models, whereby biogeochemical processing and benthic dynamics should be taken into account.}

In the present study, we discuss the influence of nutrient characteristics on the distribution and activity of nitrifiers in the water column of Cochin Estuary (CE), a tropical estuary along the southeast Arabian Sea (SEAS). Nitrifying bacteria (i.e. Ammonia- (AOB) and nitrite- (NOB) -oxidizing bacteria), which were enumerated using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), showed marked seasonality while maintaining the abundance within an order of 107 cells L$-$1. Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of AOB exhibited spatio-temporal adaptability without much variation. Nitrification rate in the CE ranged from 2.25 to 426.17 nmol N L$-$1 h$-$1 and it was 10--40 fold higher during the pre-monsoon compared with the monsoon. We attributed this increase to high nutrient availability during pre-monsoon due to low flushing rate of the estuary. The study shows that the distribution and activities of nitrifiers in the CE are modulated by the changes in nutrient concentration imparted by the monsoon-driven seasonal variation in river-water discharge and flushing.}

In addition to effects of temperature and eutrophication, recent research has shed new light on the possible implications of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Depletion of dissolved CO2 by dense cyanobacterial blooms creates a concentration gradient across the air--water interface. A steeper gradient at elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations will lead to a greater influx of CO2, which can be intercepted by surface-dwelling blooms, thus intensifying cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic waters. Bloom-forming cyanobacteria display an unexpected diversity in CO2 responses, because different strains combine their uptake systems for CO2 and bicarbonate in different ways. The genetic composition of cyanobacterial blooms may therefore shift. In particular, strains with high-flux carbon uptake systems may benefit from the anticipated rise in inorganic carbon availability. Increasing temperatures also stimulate cyanobacterial growth. Many bloom-forming cyanobacteria and also green algae have temperature optima above 25 °C, often exceeding the temperature optima of diatoms and dinoflagellates. Analysis of published data suggests that the temperature dependence of the growth rate of cyanobacteria exceeds that of green algae. Indirect effects of elevated temperature, like an earlier onset and longer duration of thermal stratification, may also shift the competitive balance in favor of buoyant cyanobacteria while eukaryotic algae are impaired by higher sedimentation losses. Furthermore, cyanobacteria differ from eukaryotic algae in that they can fix dinitrogen, and new insights show that the nitrogen-fixation activity of heterocystous cyanobacteria can be strongly stimulated at elevated temperatures. Models and lake studies indicate that the response of cyanobacterial growth to rising CO2 concentrations and elevated temperatures can be suppressed by nutrient limitation. The greatest response of cyanobacterial blooms to climate change is therefore expected to occur in eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes.}

 abstract = {Reactive transport models (RTMs) are powerful tools for disentangling the complex process interplay that drives estuarine biogeochemical dynamics, for assessing the quantitative role of estuaries in global biogeochemical cycles and for predicting their response to anthropogenic disturbances (land-use change, climate change and water management). Nevertheless, the application of RTMs for a regional or global estimation of estuarine biogeochemical transformations and fluxes is generally compromised by their high computational and data demands. Here, we describe C-GEM (Carbon-Generic Estuary Model), a new one-dimensional, computationally efficient RTM that reduces data requirements by using a generic, theoretical framework based on the direct relationship between estuarine geometry and hydrodynamics. Despite its efficiency, it provides an accurate description of estuarine hydrodynamics, salt transport and biogeochemistry on the appropriate spatio-temporal scales. We provide a detailed description of the model, as well as a protocol for its set-up. The new model is then applied to the funnel-shaped Scheldt estuary (BE/NL), one of the best-surveyed estuarine systems in the world. Its performance is evaluated through comprehensive model-data and model-model comparisons. Model results show that C-GEM captures the dominant features of the biogeochemical cycling in the Scheldt estuary. Longitudinal steady-state profiles of oxygen, ammonium, nitrate and silica are generally in good agreement with measured data. In addition, simulated, system-wide integrated reaction rates of the main pelagic biogeochemical processes are comparable with those obtained using a high-resolved, two-dimensional RTM. A comparison of fully transient simulations results with those of a two-dimensional model shows that the estuarine net ecosystem metabolism (NEM) only differs by about 10{\%}, while system-wide estimates of individual biogeochemical processes never diverge by more than 40{\%}. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to assess the sensitivity of biogeochemical processes to uncertainties in parameter values. Results reveal that the geometric parameters LC (estuarine convergence length) and H (water depth), as well as the rate constant of organic matter degradation (kox) exert an important influence on the biogeochemical functioning of the estuary. The sensitivity results also show that, currently, the most important hurdle towards regional- or global-scale applications arises from the lack of an objective framework for sediment and biogeochemical process parameterization. They, therefore, emphasize the need for a global compilation of biogeochemical parameter values that can help identify common trends and possible relationships between parameters and controlling factors, such as climate, catchment characteristics and anthropic pressure. {\copyright}Author(s) 2014.}

 journal = {Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci.},
 abstract = {This study applies the Carbon-Generic Estuary Model (C-GEM) modeling platform to simulate the estuarine biogeochemical dynamics - in particular the air-water CO2 exchange - in three idealized tidal estuaries characterized by increasing riverine influence, from a so-called {\textquotedbl}marine estuary{\textquotedbl} to a {\textquotedbl}riverine estuary{\textquotedbl}. An intermediate case called {\textquotedbl}mixed estuary{\textquotedbl} is also considered. C-GEM uses a generic biogeochemical reaction network and a unique set of model parameters extracted from a comprehensive literature survey to perform steady-state simulations representing average conditions for temperate estuaries worldwide. Climate and boundary conditions are extracted from published global databases (e.g., World Ocean Atlas, GLORICH) and catchment model outputs (GlobalNEWS2). The whole-system biogeochemical indicators net ecosystem metabolism (NEM), C and N filtering capacities (FCTC and FCTN, respectively) and CO2 gas exchanges (FCO2) are calculated across the three idealized systems and are related to their main hydrodynamic and transport characteristics. A sensitivity analysis, which propagates the parameter uncertainties, is also carried out, followed by projections of changes in the biogeochemical indicators for the year 2050. Results show that the average C filtering capacities for baseline conditions are 40, 30 and 22 {\%} for the marine, mixed and riverine estuary, respectively, while N filtering capacities, calculated in a similar fashion, range from 22 {\%} for the marine estuary to 18 and 15 {\%} for the mixed and the riverine estuaries. Sensitivity analysis performed by varying the rate constants for aerobic degradation, denitrification and nitrification over the range of values reported in the literature significantly widens these ranges for both C and N. Simulations for the year 2050 suggest that all estuaries will remain largely heterotrophic, although a slight improvement of the estuarine trophic status is predicted. In addition, our results suggest that, while the riverine and mixed systems will only marginally be affected by an increase in atmospheric pCO2, the marine estuary is likely to become a significant CO2 sink in its downstream section. In the decades to come, such a change in behavior might strengthen the overall CO2 sink of the estuary-coastal ocean continuum.}

 abstract = {This study presents the first regional application of the generic estuarine reactive-transport model C-GEM (Carbon-Generic Estuary Model) that is here combined with high-resolution databases to produce a carbon and CO2 budget for all tidal estuaries discharging into the North Sea. Steady-state simulations are performed for yearly-averaged conditions to quantify the carbon processing in the six main tidal estuaries Elbe, Ems, Humber, Scheldt, Thames, and Weser, which show contrasted physical and biogeochemical dynamics and contribute the most to the regional filter. The processing rates derived from these simulations are then extrapolated to the riverine carbon loads of all the other North Sea catchments intercepted by smaller tidal estuarine systems. The Rhine-Meuse estuarine system is also included in the carbon budget and overall, we calculate that the export of organic and inorganic carbon from tidal estuaries to the North sea amounts to 44 and 409 Gmol C yr-1, respectively, while 41 Gmol C are lost annually through CO2 outgassing. The carbon is mostly exported from the estuaries in its inorganic form ({\textgreater}90{\%}), a result that reflects the low organic/inorganic carbon ratio of the riverine waters, as well as the very intense decomposition of organic carbon within the estuarine systems. Our calculations also reveal that with a filtering capacity of 15{\%} for total carbon, the contribution of estuaries to the CO2 outgassing is relatively small. Organic carbon dynamics is dominated by heterotrophic degradation, which also represents the most important contribution to the estuarine CO2 evasion. Nitrification only plays a marginal role in the CO2 dynamics, while the contribution of riverine oversaturated waters to the CO2 outgassing is generally significant and strongly varies across systems.},

N2O natural production rates ranged between 0.10 $μ$mol N m-2 h-1 and 8.50 $μ$mol N m-2 h-1, and the denitrification rates ranged from 18.71 $μ$mol N m-2 h-1 to 35.87 $μ$mol N m-2 h-1. The N2O natural production rates in overlying water were low, with intertidal sediment being the source of overlying water N2O during the submerged period. Data analysis indicated that most sediment N2O was not derived from denitrification, but from several other nitrogen-cycling processes. During the low tide, the middle tidal marsh was the source of atmosphere N2O (exchange fluxes changed between -11.03 $μ$mol N m-2 h-1 and 13.17 $μ$mol N m-2 h-1). 5 cm and 10 cm depth ground temperatures were significant factors controlling the emission flux. At the low tidal flat, N2O emission flux rates ranged from -5.75 $μ$mol N m-2 h-1 to 0.49 $μ$mol N m-2 h-1 at the sediment-atmosphere interface. Overall, the middle tidal marsh was the source of atmospheric N2O, while the low tidal flat was a sink for atmospheric N2O. Plants of the intertidal zone (Scirpus mariqueter and benthic algae) were significant factors controlling N2O exchange flux. Photosynthesis of intertidal zone plants inhibited the emission of N2O and induced consumption, while plant respiration may enhance N2O emission from the intertidal zone. N2O emission and consumption at the intertidal zone-atmosphere interface correlated positively with the emission and consumption of CO2. {\copyright}2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

In comparison, the heavily eutrophied river network is an important fraction of the local N(2)O budget, and when considered together with emissions of N(2)O from the lake, constitute a major (10-50{\%} depending on season) fraction of total N(2)O emissions from the Lake Taihu drainage basin.}

Moreover, the average density of phytoplankton was 42.39 $\times$ 106~cells/L, indicating that those landscape water bodies belonged to moderate eutrophication. The results of RDA revealed that the most significant environmental factors influencing phytoplankton community were water temperature (WT), dissolved total phosphorus (DTP), salinity, and total nitrogen (TN) (p~{\textless} 0.05, Monte Carlo permutation test). Meanwhile, Aphanocapsa elachista was positively correlated with WT, TN, and salinity, while Cyclotella meneghiniana was positively related to salinity and negatively related to TP.

Another important result was that the CH4 concentrations and fluxes increased with the degree of urbanization or the proportion of urban land use, being approximately 3-13 times higher in urban and suburban areas than in rural ones. The total nitrogen, dissolved oxygen (O{\%}) and possible sewage discharge, which could affect the in situ CH4 production and exogenous CH4 input respectively, were important factors that influenced the spatial patterns of CH4 in human-dominated river networks, while the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) could be good predictors of the CH4 emissions in urban watersheds. Hydrologic drivers, including bottom sediment type, flow velocity and river width, were strongly correlated with the CH4 concentrations and could also affect the spatial variance and predict the CH4 hotspots in such metropolitan river networks. With increasing urbanization, we should pay more attention to the increasing greenhouse gas emissions associated with urbanization.}

 abstract = {Polluted urban river systems might be a strong source of atmospheric methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), but so far only a few urban river systems have been quantified with regard to their source strength for greenhouse gases (GHGs). In this study, we measured loads of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and organic carbon, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, and fluxes of CH4 and N2O from an urban river in Beijing, China during the course of an entire year. Fluxes calculated using the floating chamber approach or via the diffusion method with measurements of river water GHG concentrations showed comparable temporal variations. However, the flux magnitude based on the diffusion method was found to strongly depend on the underlying parameterization of the gas transfer velocity. In view of the large differences while applying different methodologies to estimate surface water GHG fluxes further studies are still needed to prove and eventually quantify the systematic errors which are likely caused by either the chamber technique or the approaches of individual diffusion models. For both the floating chamber and the diffusion-based flux estimates, strong seasonal variations in CH4 and N2O fluxes from the river surface were observed, with fluxes ranging from 3 to 8374~\textgreek{m}g~C m-2~h-1 for CH4 and 1-3986~\textgreek{m}g~N m-2~h-1 for N2O. The CH4 fluxes were strongly negatively correlated with the DO concentration (P~{\textless}~0.01). The highest N2O fluxes were observed at times with low CH4 fluxes (i.e., in spring and autumn). Annual CH4 and N2O fluxes totaled 19.3-79.4 and 17.4-44.8~kg~C (N) ha-1~yr-1, respectively. These high fluxes are in agreement with estimates from the few other studies carried out for urban river systems to date and indicate that urban polluted river systems are a significant regional source of atmospheric GHGs.}

 abstract = {Transport and fate of phytoplankton blooms and excessive nutrients along salinity and turbidity gradients of a river-estuary continuum could determine when and where impaired water quality occurs. However, the general spatiotemporal patterns, underlying mechanisms and their implication for water quality management are not well understood. This study reveals typical seasonal variations and longitudinal patterns of phytoplankton, dissolved oxygen (DO) and nutrients (C, N, and P) in the lower St. Johns River estuary in Florida based on 23 years of data and a model which spans 3 years. Evident declines in freshwater phytoplankton and DO concentrations were observed in the freshwater-saltwater transition zone and the estuarine turbidity maxima along the river-estuary continuum. Observations show that most cyanobacteria blooms originating from upstream lakes collapsed in the freshwater-saltwater transition zone where salinity was greater than 1~ppt, but data analysis and model simulation both indicate salinity stress was not the sole reason, other factors such as changes in hydrodynamics and river morphology also contributed to the bloom crashes. Inorganic nutrients (ammonium, nitrate, and phosphate) exhibited inverse longitudinal patterns with phytoplankton. Due to algal uptake, summer concentrations of inorganic nutrients were low in the freshwater, but substantially elevated in the marine reach as a result of large point source inputs and nutrient regeneration from organic detritus. However, because of strong river-ocean mixing, the dramatic increase in nutrients did not promote a phytoplankton bloom in the local marine reach. The nutrients were eventually transported into coastal waters or oceans where they fueled phytoplankton blooms. Our findings highlight that strategies for nutrient reduction and phytoplankton bloom management should be developed beyond local reaches and across a river-estuary-ocean continuum, exploring the possibility that freshwater phytoplankton blooms and excessive nutrients may be transported to downstream estuaries, coastal waters and even oceans that are vulnerable to poor water quality.}

 abstract = {The evasions of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from inland waters represent substantial fluxes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, offsetting a large part of the continental carbon sink. However, the CH4 and CO2 emissions from urban inland waters are less constrained. In particular, ebullitive CH4 emissions from these waters are poorly understood. Here, we measured the concentrations and fluxes of CH4 and CO2 in rivers and lakes in the megacity of Beijing, China, between 2018 and 2019. The CH4 concentration ranged from 0.08 to 70.2 µmol L-1 with an average of 2.5 $\pm$ 5.9 µmol L-1. The average CH4 ebullition was 11.3 $\pm$ 30.4 mmol m-2 d-1 and was approximately 6 times higher than the global average. The average total CH4 flux (14.2 $\pm$ 35.1 mmol m-2 d-1) was 3 times higher than the global average, with ebullition accounting for 80{\%} of the flux. The high surface water CH4 concentrations and ebullitive fluxes were caused by high sediment organic carbon/dissolved organic carbon contents, high aquatic primary productivity and shallow water depths in the urban inland waters. The CH4 emissions accounted for 20{\%} of CO2 emissions in terms of the carbon release and were 1.7 times higher in terms of CO2 equivalent emissions from Beijing inland waters. Furthermore, the CH4 ebullition and its contribution to the total carbon gas emissions increased exponentially with the water temperature, suggesting a positive feedback probably occurs between the greenhouse gas emissions from urban inland waters and climate warming. This study confirms the major role of CH4 ebullition from urban inland waters in the global carbon budget under the rapid progress of global urbanization.}

These pressures will be manifest as alterations in temperature, stratification, light, ocean acidification, precipitation-induced nutrient inputs, and grazing, but absence of fundamental knowledge of the mechanisms driving harmful algal blooms frustrates most hope of forecasting their future prevalence. Summarized here is the consensus of a recent workshop held to address what currently is known and not known about the environmental conditions that favor initiation and maintenance of harmful algal blooms. There is expectation that harmful algal bloom (HAB) geographical domains should expand in some cases, as will seasonal windows of opportunity for harmful algal blooms at higher latitudes. Nonetheless there is only basic information to speculate upon which regions or habitats HAB species may be the most resilient or susceptible. Moreover, current research strategies are not well suited to inform these fundamental linkages. There is a critical absence of tenable hypotheses for how climate pressures mechanistically affect HAB species, and the lack of uniform experimental protocols limits the quantitative cross-investigation comparisons essential to advancement. A HAB {\textquotedbl}best practices{\textquotedbl} manual would help foster more uniform research strategies and protocols, and selection of a small target list of model HAB species or isolates for study would greatly promote the accumulation of knowledge. Despite the need to focus on keystone species, more studies need to address strain variability within species, their responses under multifactorial conditions, and the retrospective analyses of long-term plankton and cyst core data; research topics that are departures from the norm. Examples of some fundamental unknowns include how larger and more frequent extreme weather events may break down natural biogeographic barriers, how stratification may enhance or diminish HAB events, how trace nutrients (metals, vitamins) influence cell toxicity, and how grazing pressures may leverage, or mitigate HAB development. There is an absence of high quality time-series data in most regions currently experiencing HAB outbreaks, and little if any data from regions expected to develop HAB events in the future. A subset of observer sites is recommended to help develop stronger linkages among global, national, and regional climate change and HAB observation programs, providing fundamental datasets for investigating global changes in the prevalence of harmful algal blooms. Forecasting changes in HAB patterns over the next few decades will depend critically upon considering harmful algal blooms within the competitive context of plankton communities, and linking these insights to ecosystem, oceanographic and climate models. From a broader perspective, the nexus of HAB science and the social sciences of harmful algal blooms is inadequate and prevents quantitative assessment of impacts of future HAB changes on human well-being. These and other fundamental changes in HAB research will be necessary if HAB science is to obtain compelling evidence that climate change has caused alterations in HAB distributions, prevalence or character, and to develop the theoretical, experimental, and empirical evidence explaining the mechanisms underpinning these ecological shifts.}

 abstract = {A eutrophication assessment method was developed as part of the National Estuarine Eutrophication Assessment (NEEA) Program. The program is designed to improve monitoring and assessment of eutrophication in the estuaries and coastal bays of the United States with the intent to guide management plans and develop analytical and research models and tools for managers. These tools will help guide and improve management success for estuaries and coastal resources. The assessment method, a Pressure-State-Response approach, uses a simple model to determine Pressure and statistical criteria for indicator variables (where applicable) to determine State. The Response determination is mostly heuristic, although research models are being developed to improve that component. The three components are determined individually and then combined into a single rating. Application to several systems in the European Union (E.U.), specifically in Portugal, shows that the method is transferable, and thus is useful for development of management measures in both the Unites States and E.U. This approach identifies and quantifies the key anthropogenic nutrient input sources to estuaries so that management measures can target inputs for maximum effect. Because nitrogen is often the limiting nutrient in estuarine systems, examples of source identification and quantification for nitrogen have been developed for 11 coastal watersheds on the U.S. east coast using the WATERSN model. In general, estuaries in the Northeastern United States receive most of their nitrogen from human sewage, followed by atmospheric deposition. This is in contrast to some watersheds in the Mid-Atlantic (Chesapeake Bay) and South Atlantic (Pamlico Sound), which receive most of their nitrogen from agricultural runoff. Source identification is important for implementing effective management measures that should be monitored for success using assessment methods, as described herein. For instance, these results suggest that Northeastern estuaries would likely benefit most from improved sewage treatment, where as the Mid and South Atlantic systems would benefit most from agricultural runoff reductions.}

 journal = {Estuar. Coast. Shelf Sci.},
 abstract = {Estuaries are amongst the most productive marine ecosystems of the world but are also some of the most degraded due to coastal urban development. Sparse sampling of complex interactions between estuarine physics, sediment transport, chemistry, and biology limits understanding of the processes controlling estuarine water quality and confounds active management. We use a 3D coupled hydrodynamic, sediment and biogeochemical model to identify the key mechanisms driving fine-scale fluctuations in water quality in a temperate micro-tidal salt wedge estuary [Derwent Estuary, Tasmania]. Model results are dynamically consistent with relatively sparse monitoring data collected over a seasonal cycle and are considered to be a plausible hypothesis of sub-monitoring scale processes occurring in the estuary. The model shows enhanced mixing of nutrients across the pycnocline downstream of the salt wedge front that supports a persistent phytoplankton bloom. The length and flow regime of the estuary results in nutrient recycling and retention in the estuarine circulation driving a decline in bottom water dissolved oxygen in the mid- and upper-reaches. A budget analysis of modelled nitrogen suggests high levels of denitrification are critical to the maintenance of existing water quality. Active estuarine management focused on the improvement of bottom water dissolved oxygen for ecological health reasons must either concurrently reduce anthropogenic nitrogen loads or be sure to maintain high levels of microbial denitrification for net water quality improvement. {\copyright}2013.},

 abstract = {The fine-scale ({\textless}100 m; {\textless}1 day) skill of a 3D biogeochemical estuarine model cannot be assessed by traditional discrete monitoring programmes. Whilst continuous temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, turbidity and oxygen sensors based on electrical and optical properties have been deployed at individual sites, in underway and in profiling configurations, continuous estuarine nutrient sensors are in their infancy. In this paper we present data from 3 continuous nutrient observing systems deployed in a temperate estuary: a Systea Wet Chemistry analyser deployed at the head of the estuary to characterise river water entering the estuary; an in situ ultra-violet optical nitrate analyser deployed on a benthic lander at the mouth of the estuary to ascertain the marine nitrate concentrations entering the estuary; and a rapid reverse flow injection analysis system to achieve a high resolution spatial survey of conditions throughout the estuary. Our observations capture seasonal and synoptic timescale variability in marine and river nutrient concentrations and characterise plumes of nutrient enrichment associated with point source discharge against a background estuarine gradient. At the head of the estuary nutrient concentrations were greater and varied in ratio compared to previous observations. Results from a fine-scale 3D biogeochemical model (Wild-Allen et al., 2013) captured 66{\%} of the observed synoptic timescale variability in nitrate concentration at the mouth of the estuary, but did not propagate the observed synoptic timescale fluctuations in river nutrients into the domain when forced with an upstream boundary condition of interpolated monthly observations. The absence of proxies for observing river nutrients dictates further investment in automated nutrient analysis to better inform the model and characterise evolving river conditions. Modelled surface nutrient fields matched observed spatial snapshots of estuarine conditions in contrasting years with surprising accuracy and suggest persistent spatial patterns that might usefully be characterised with neural network self organising maps.},

 abstract = {In order to complete a thorough and systematic assessment of water quality, it is useful to measure the absorption capacity of a river. Absorption capacity is understood as a pollution load introduced into river water that will not cause permanent and irreversible changes in the aquatic ecosystem and will not cause a change in the classification of water quality in the river profile. In order to implement the method, the Macromodel DNS/SWAT basin for the Middle Warta pilot (central Poland) was used to simulate nutrient loads. This enabled detailed analysis of water quality in each water body and the assessment of the size of the absorption capacity parameter, which allows the determination of how much pollution can be added to the river without compromising its quality class. Positive values of the calculated absorption capacity parameter mean that it is assumed that the ecosystem is adjusted in such a way that it can eliminate pollution loads through a number of self-purification processes. Negative values indicate that the load limit has been exceeded, and too much pollution has been introduced into the ecosystem for it to be able to deal with through the processes of self-purification. Absorption capacity thus enables the connection of environmental standards of water quality and water quality management plans in order to meet these standards.}

Tidal mixing leads to a seaward decline of dissolved gaseous concentrations and water-air fluxes along the river-estuary gradient. Denitrification at freshwater sites varied between seasons, associated with changes in N input and water temperature. The denitrification process was controlled by the nitrate level at freshwater sites, and the excess dissolved N$_2$ observed at the tidal zone largely originated from upstream water transport. Compared to other estuaries, JRE has a relative low gaseous removal efficiency (E(d)=12{\%} of [DIN]; annual N removal=24{\%} of DIN load), a fact ascribed to strong tidal mixing, coarse-textured sediment with shallow depth before bedrock and high riverine DIN input.}

 abstract = {The biogeochemistry of a small tropical river and estuary (the Wanquan River (WQR)) in Hainan, China, was studied to obtain information on the sources, transformation and fate of riverine organic matter. Water and total suspended matter were sampled along a salinity gradient during four field campaigns in December 2006, August 2007, July-August 2008 and April 2009. We were able to observe the effect of heavy precipitation associated with the tropical cyclone Kammuri (2008) and a strong first-rain event (2009) on the export of organic carbon. Both dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) generally decreased with increasing salinity in the estuary, with minimal seasonal or annual variations. The POC concentrations were in the range of 18-178$μ$M for the WQR and were significantly correlated with chlorophyll a concentrations. The highest average values of DOC ({\~{}}190$μ$M) were observed in 2009. These values could be the result of the flushing effect of the first rain. In the high-salinity zone, in situ productivity could be an important source for DOC. The $δ$13Corg values of particles (-29.5‰ to -23.2‰), combined with the ratio of organic carbon to total nitrogen (OC/TN), reflect a mixture of terrestrial organic matter and in situ production. The amplitudes of the POC and DOC variations on the occasion of the first-rain event of 2009 were larger than those observed during Kammuri. It is estimated that 29.8tday-1 of DOC and 10.4tday-1 of POC, representing 6-10{\%} of the annual loads, were delivered to the coast during the 10-day period of the first flush event in 2009.

Experimental studies were conducted for natural water of the Yellow River under laboratory conditions. Nitrification kinetics was investigated in water systems with various levels of suspended-solid contents. The associated mechanisms were analyzed through investigation of the adsorption-desorption of ammonium nitrogen, the process of bacteria growth, and the feature of nitrification kinetics. The results indicated that the presence of suspended solids could accelerate the nitrification process. The nitrification rate would increase non-linearly with the increase of suspended-solid content. When the initial concentration of ammonia nitrogen was 12.70 mg/l in the water system, the ratios of half-time duration for nitrification would be 1.88:1.23:1 under suspended-solid contents of 0, 1.84 and 5.00 g/l, respectively. When the initial concentration of ammonia nitrogen was around 1.0 mg/l in the water system, the nitrification rates in systems with suspended-solid contents of 1.81 and 3.42 g/l would then be approximately 9 and 12 times that without suspended solids, respectively. The populations of nitrifying bacteria would rise with increasing suspended-solid content. The existence of suspended solids would increase the contact chances between bacteria and nitrogen, resulting in accelerated nitrification processes; this was manifested by the increased K 4 ($μ$ max/K S) along with the raised suspended-solid contents while fitting nitrification kinetics with the growth-based logistic model. Since the amount of ammonium nitrogen adsorbed on suspended-solid surface was non-linearly proportional to the suspended-solid content, the nitrification rate was also non-linearly proportional to the suspended-solid content. {\copyright}2004 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {High suspended sediment (SPS) concentrations exist in many Asian river systems. In this research, the effects of SPS concentration on nitrification in river water systems were studied. With or without introducing ammonium-oxidizing bacteria isolated from the water and sediment samples of the Yellow River, the microbially mediated nitrification rate increased with SPS concentration as described by the power function y = a·xb, where y is the nitrification rate, x is the SPS concentration, and a and b are constants. With an indigenous ammonium-oxidizing bacteria, nitrification rate constants, i.e., K4 ($μ$max/KS) values obtained from the Monod model, were 0.0016, 0.0036, 0.0040, 0.0063, 0.0066, 0.0071, and 0.0077 day -1 $μ$M-1 for the systems with SPS concentrations of 0, 0.2 1.0, 5.0, 10, 20, and 40 g/L, respectively. The sorption percentage of NH4+-N increased with SPS concentration as a power function. Bacteria tend to attach onto SPS, and the maximum specific growth rate at the SPS-water interface was about twice that in the water phase. An increase of bacterial population and nitrification rate constant with SPS as a power function resulted in an increase of nitrification rate with SPS as a power function. Therefore, the high SPS concentration caused by erosion and bottom sediment resuspension and other factors will accelerate ammonium oxidation in many turbid river systems. This has useful implications for nitrogen removal from river systems. {\copyright}2009 American Chemical Society.}

 abstract = {In this paper we describe the development and validation of a relatively simple biogeochemical model of Chesapeake Bay. This model consists of a 3-dimensional, prognostic hydrodynamic model that is coupled to an NPZD-type open ocean ecosystem model, which has been modified by adding additional compartments and parameterizations of biogeochemical processes that are important in estuarine systems. These modifications include an empirical optical model for predicting the diffuse attenuation coefficient Kd, compartments for representing oxygen and suspended sediment concentrations, and parameterizations of phosphorus limitation, denitrification, and seasonal changes in ecosystem structure and temperature effects. To show the overall performance of the coupled physical-biological model, the modeled dissolved inorganic nitrogen, phytoplankton, dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids and light attenuation coefficient in 1995 (a dry year) and 1996 (a very wet year) are examined and compared with observations obtained from the Chesapeake Bay Program. We demonstrate that this relatively simple model is capable of producing the general distribution of each field (both the mean and variability) in the main stem of the Bay. And the model is robust enough to generate reasonable results under both wet and dry conditions. Some significant discrepancies are also observed, such as overestimation of phytoplankton concentrations in shoal regions and overestimation of oxygen concentrations in deep channels, which reveal some deficiencies in the model formulation. Some potential improvements and remedies are suggested. Sensitivity studies on selected parameters are also reported. {\copyright}2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

Here, we demonstrate that for millennia, human populations have resided in the same narrow part of the climatic envelope available on the globe, characterized by a major mode around $\sim$11 °C to 15 °C mean annual temperature (MAT). Supporting the fundamental nature of this temperature niche, current production of crops and livestock is largely limited to the same conditions, and the same optimum has been found for agricultural and nonagricultural economic output of countries through analyses of year-to-year variation. We show that in a business-as-usual climate change scenario, the geographical position of this temperature niche is projected to shift more over the coming 50 y than it has moved since 6000 BP. Populations will not simply track the shifting climate, as adaptation in situ may address some of the challenges, and many other factors affect decisions to migrate. Nevertheless, in the absence of migration, one third of the global population is projected to experience a MAT {\textgreater}29 °C currently found in only 0.8{\%} of the Earth's land surface, mostly concentrated in the Sahara. As the potentially most affected regions are among the poorest in the world, where adaptive capacity is low, enhancing human development in those areas should be a priority alongside climate mitigation.},

 abstract = {This study investigated the variations of dissolved N2O and emissions over diurnal and seasonal temporal scales in 2009, as well as the time series of riverine N2O export to estuary and emission to atmosphere in response to increasing anthropogenic nitrogen loads in the Changjiang River. For the diurnal study, N2O concentrations ranged from 0.26 to 0.34 and from 0.44 to 0.52 $μ$g N-N2O L-1 in August and October 2009, respectively. The dissolved N2O was supersaturated with a mean value of 197{\%}. Studies on N2O emissions, also taken in August and October, ranged from 2.67 to 11.6 and from 6.72 to 15.2 $μ$g N-N 2O m-2 h-1, respectively. For the seasonal study (June through December 2009), N2O concentrations ranged from 0.34 to 0.72 $μ$g N-N2O L-1 and were supersaturated in all the samples (average 212{\%}). N2O emissions ranged from 1.87 to 40.8 $μ$g N-N2O m-2 h-1. Our study found no significant differences in diurnal patterns of N2O saturation but detected significant difference in seasonal patterns of N2O saturation: higher during summer while lower during autumn and winter. We found a significant relationship between dissolved N2O and river nitrate, which can predict the variation of N2O concentrations in the River. The net production of N2 ranged from 0.01 to 0.47 mg N-N2 L-1. These excess N2 values were significantly correlated to the N2O production and are suggestive of denitrification in the river. Applying the Global News model to the river system using measures taken during the 1970 to 2002 period, we estimated N2O emissions to atmosphere increased from 330 to 3650 ton N-N2O yr-1. During that same 1970-2002 period, N2O exports to estuary increased from 91 to 470 ton N-N2O yr-1. Taken together, the findings reported here suggest that both the river N2O concentrations and emissions would increase in response to rising anthropogenic nitrogen loads. Our study showed that the mean emission factor based on the ratio of the total N2O flux to NO3- flux is four times greater than the value of 0.0025 obtained with the methodology recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Thus, our findings reflect the open river channel rapid exchange of gases with the atmosphere. {\copyright}2012. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.}

 abstract = {The western subarctic Pacific (WSP) is known as one of the most productive regions among the world's oceans in spring. However, its oceanic waters are also known as a High Nutrient, Low Chlorophyll (HNLC) region during summer due to low iron (Fe) availability in seawater. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that the distribution of Fe in the WSP is complex and heterogeneous. This study thus investigated the effects of Fe availability on the community composition and photophysiology of surface phytoplankton from coastal to offshore waters in the WSP in the summer of 2014. Although relatively high concentrations ({\textgreater}2 mg m-3) of chlorophyll (chl) a were found in the Sea of Okhotsk and some coastal waters, low chl a concentrations ({\textless}1 mg m-3) were commonly observed in offshore waters. Based on dissolved Fe and macronutrient concentrations, we deduced that low Fe availability limited phytoplankton growth in offshore waters, whereas low silicate and/or nitrate levels limited growth in the shelf areas. Scanning electron microscopy also revealed that the centric diatom Chaetoceros exclusively dominated the diatom assemblages in the shelf and coexisted with pennate diatoms in offshore waters, respectively. Primary productivity in surface waters was negatively correlated with the bottom of the euphotic layer or the light saturation index of the photosynthesis-irradiance curve, which indicates that the phytoplankton assemblages were well acclimated to in situ light conditions regardless of the water masses.}

 abstract = {Global nitrogen (N) enrichment has resulted in increased nitrous oxide (N2O) emission that greatly contributes to climate change and stratospheric ozone destruction, but little is known about the N2O emissions from urban river networks receiving anthropogenic N inputs. We examined N2O saturation and emission in the Shanghai city river network, covering 6300 km2, over 27 months. The overall mean saturation and emission from 87 locations was 770{\%} and 1.91 mg N2O-N m-2 d-1, respectively. Nitrous oxide (N2O) saturation did not exhibit a clear seasonality, but the temporal pattern was co-regulated by both water temperature and N loadings. Rivers draining through urban and suburban areas receiving more sewage N inputs had higher N2O saturation and emission than those in rural areas. Regression analysis indicated that water ammonium (NH4+) and dissolved oxygen (DO) level had great control on N2O production and were better predictors of N2O emission in urban watershed. About 0.29 Gg N2O-N yr-1 N2O was emitted from the Shanghai river network annually, which was about 131{\%} of IPCC's prediction using default emission values. Given the rapid progress of global urbanization, more study efforts, particularly on nitrification and its N2O yielding, are needed to better quantify the role of urban rivers in global riverine N2O emission. {\copyright}2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.}

 abstract = {Higher nitrogen fluxes through estuaries increase the risk of harmful algal blooms, may expand eutrophication and can cause hypoxia within estuaries and the adjacent coastal areas. However, the key factors controlling dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations and export from hydrologically dynamic and turbid estuarine systems are still poorly understood. A series of cruises with high spatial resolution under different hydrological conditions were conducted in 2015--2016 across the Jiulong River Estuary (JRE) continuum, including the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM). During baseflow, ETMs were more intense during spring tides than neap tides due to stronger net sediment resuspension. The turbidity maxima were stronger and generally further downstream under flood-affected conditions. Based on the distribution of ammonium on the salinity gradient in the low salinity region of the estuary ({\textless}2 PSU), we grouped all the cruises into ``NH 4 Addition Pattern (AP)'' and ``NH 4 Removal Pattern (RP)''. During baseflow, AP occurred during neap tides and RP during spring tides. An important source of ammonium to the water column was from resuspended sediments and their pore waters. Based on property-salinity plots, nitrification was likely one of the most important transformation processes in the turbid water column of the JRE, resulting in the net removal of ammonium and the net addition of nitrite. It was more intense during spring tides because there were more suspended particles carrying nitrifying bacteria. There was a major addition of DIN from estuarine processes in addition to the extra nitrogen flushed from the catchment during flood-affected flow, in particular during the first flood of the year, compared with a comparatively minor addition during baseflow. This additional DIN was likely from the breakdown products of particulate organic nitrogen accumulated in sediments which were then resuspended under flood-affected conditions.}

 abstract = {Organic carbon in estuarine sediments can have many different sources. Terrestrial, riverine, estuarine and marine C pools may all contribute to and influence the organic C (Corg) inventory of the estuarine sediments and the differing stable isotope signatures of the sources are reflected in the sediment's overall 13C content. Ecological interpretations of sedimentary isotope data may, however, be limited by the fact the total Corg inventory of a sediment may not be an accurate representation of the fraction that is labile and being actively turned over by the sedimentary community. To gain a better understanding of sedimentary Corg dynamics in estuaries and the relationship between the sedimentary C pool and the Corg undergoing mineralisation, we studied three components of an estuarine system: (1) the sedimentary Corg inventory on a transect from the mouth to the upper end of the estuary, (2) temporal changes of sedimentary Corg at one station throughout a year, and (3) the $δ$13C of respired CO2 compared to the $δ$13C of available source material and sedimentary Corg in a novel application of methods developed for soil science. Our experiments demonstrated that material of marine origin dominated the studied estuary. At the time-series station, material of marine origin dominated the sedimentary Corg throughout the 1-yr study period. $δ$13C values of CO2 released from the sediment differed significantly from the sedimentary Corg inventory at all study sites, but also clearly reflected differences between the main sections of the estuary. These results suggest that $δ$13C measurements of respired CO2 are promising as a tool to advance our understanding of C cycling in estuaries, and highlight that the sedimentary Corg pool alone may not be a satisfactory indicator of OM utilisation in estuarine sediments. {\copyright}2011 Elsevier Ltd.}

Dissolved N2O concentrations ranged from 6.04 to 21.3 nM, and indicate great temporal and spatial variations. Distribution of N2O in the Changjiang Estuary was influenced by multiple factors and the key factor varied between cruises. Dissolved riverine N2O was observed monthly at station Xuliujing of the Changjiang, and ranged from 12.4 to 33.3 nM with an average of 19.4 $\pm$ 7.3 nM. N2O concentrations in the river waters showed obvious seasonal variations with higher values occurring in both summer and winter. Annual input of N2O from the Changjiang to the estuary was estimated to be 15.0 $\times$ 106 mol/yr. N2O emission rates from the sediments of the Changjiang Estuary in spring ranged from -1.88 to 2.02 $μ$mol m-2 d-1, which suggests that sediment can act as either a source or a sink of N2O in the Changjiang Estuary. Average annual sea-to-air N2O fluxes from the studied area were estimated to be 7.7 $\pm$ 5.5, 15.1 $\pm$ 10.8 and 17.0 $\pm$ 12.6 $μ$mol m -2d-1 using LM86, W92 and RC01 relationships, respectively.

 abstract = {Growing evidence shows that riverine networks surrounding urban landscapes may be hotspots of riverine greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study strengthens the evidence by investigating the spatial variability of diffusive GHG (N2O, CH4, CO2) emissions from river reaches that drain from different types of landscapes (i.e., urban, agricultural, mixed, and forest landscapes), in the Chaohu Lake basin of eastern China. Our results showed that almost all the rivers were oversaturated with dissolved GHGs. Urban rivers were identified as emission hotspots, with mean fluxes of 470 \textgreek{m}mol m-2d-1 for N2O, 7~mmol m-2d-1 for CH4, and 900~mmol m-2d-1 for CO2, corresponding to {\~{}}14, seven, and two times of those from the non-urban rivers in the Chaohu Lake basin, respectively. Factors related to the high N2O and CH4 emissions in urban rivers included large nutrient supply and hypoxic environments. The factors affecting CO2 were similar in all the rivers, which were temperature-dependent with suitable environments that allowed rapid decomposition of organic matter. Overall, this study highlights that better recognition of the influence that river networks have on global warming is required-particularly when it comes to urban rivers, as urban land cover and populations will continue to expand in the future. Management measures should incorporate regional hotspots to more efficiently mitigate GHG emissions.}

 abstract = {Shallow lakes account for most of the diffusive CH4 emissions from global lakes, and they also suffer from eutrophication worldwide. Determining the effect of eutrophication on diffusive CH4 fluxes is fundamental to understanding CH4 emissions in shallow lakes. This study aimed to investigate the spatial variations in diffusive CH4 fluxes and explore the role of eutrophication in Lake Chaohu, a large and shallow eutrophic lake in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. A one-year field observation was carried out to examine CH4 concentrations in the sediment and water and the diffusive fluxes of CH4 across the sediment-water interface (Fs-w) and water-air interface (Fw-a). Both Fs-w (0.306-1.56~mmol~m-2 d-1) and Fw-a (0.097-0.529~mmol~m-2 d-1) were upward and showed significant spatial heterogeneity and were significantly positively correlated. Parameters related to eutrophication had significant positive relationships with Fw-a, and the total phosphorus distribution in the water explained the greatest proportion of the spatial variation in Fw-a. Distance to shore and water depth were inversely correlated with Fw-a and modified the effects of eutrophication. Overall, the results provide direct evidence of the key role of eutrophication in shaping the spatial distribution of diffusive CH4 fluxes and a scientific basis for predicting changes in CH4 emissions with future eutrophication changes in shallow lakes in subtropical zones.}

 abstract = {In view of the severity of oceanic pollution, based on the finite volume coastal ocean model (FVCOM), a Lagrangian particle-tracking model was used to numerically investigate the coastal pollution transport and water exchange capability in Tangdao Bay, in China. The severe pollution in the bay was numerically simulated by releasing and tracking particles inside it. The simulation results demonstrate that the water exchange capability in the bay is very low. Once the bay has suffered pollution, a long period will be required before the environment can purify itself. In order to eliminate or at least reduce the pollution level, environmental improvement measures have been proposed to enhance the seawater exchange capability and speed up the water purification inside the bay. The study findings presented in this paper are believed to be instructive and useful for future environmental policy makers and it is also anticipated that the numerical model in this paper can serve as an effective technological tool to study many emerging coastal environment problems.}

 abstract = {Rapid economic development and urbanization necessitate an understanding of anthropogenic effects on coastal eutrophication. It is a significant challenge for governments to alleviate water degradation and remediate coastal ecosystems. Shenzhen Bay in China, located in a developed and populous area, was selected to analyze the decadal scale influence of anthropogenic activities on eutrophication as well as the effectiveness of governmental remediation strategies. The results showed that the contribution of nutrients from anthropogenic sources accounted for over 80{\%} of the total loads into the bay. Beginning in 1990, increased anthropogenic activities resulted in the loss of environmental capability and resilience, exacerbated eutrophication and water quality degradation. However, the status of eutrophication has been improved since 2005, following the application of intensive management actions implemented in 2000. The practice of eutrophication control suggested that, in view of technical and engineering feasibility, coastal strategies for similar shallow bays should initially reduce phosphorus, followed by nitrogen and eco-remediation to alleviate the serious aquatic situation immediately. The recovery period of eutrophication would be at least five years after governmental actions from Shenzhen Bay's experience. Furthermore, simulated scenarios indicated that eutrophication ranking of Shenzhen Bay could reach and remains medium Moderate, following a 35{\%} reduction in total nitrogen and a 20{\%} reduction in total phosphorus with corresponding eco-remediation.}

 abstract = {The continuous increase of nitrous oxide (N2O) abundance in the atmosphere is a global concern. Multiple pathways of N2O production occur in soil, but their significance and dependence on oxygen (O2) availability and nitrogen (N) fertilizer source are poorly understood. We examined N2O and nitric oxide (NO) production under 21{\%}, 3{\%}, 1{\%}, 0.5{\%}, and 0{\%} (vol/vol) O2 concentrations following urea or ammonium sulfate [(NH4)2SO4] additions in loam, clay loam, and sandy loam soils that also contained ample nitrate. The contribution of the ammonia (NH3) oxidation pathways (nitrifier nitrification, nitrifier denitrification, and nitrification-coupled denitrification) and heterotrophic denitrification (HD) to N2O production was determined in 36-h incubations in microcosms by (15)N-(18)O isotope and NH3 oxidation inhibition (by 0.01{\%} acetylene) methods. Nitrous oxide and NO production via NH3 oxidation pathways increased as O2 concentrations decreased from 21{\%} to 0.5{\%}. At low (0.5{\%} and 3{\%}) O2 concentrations, nitrifier denitrification contributed between 34{\%} and 66{\%}, and HD between 34{\%} and 50{\%} of total N2O production. Heterotrophic denitrification was responsible for all N2O production at 0{\%} O2. Nitrifier denitrification was the main source of N2O production from ammonical fertilizer under low O2 concentrations with urea producing more N2O than (NH4)2SO4 additions. These findings challenge established thought attributing N2O emissions from soils with high water content to HD due to presumably low O2 availability. Our results imply that management practices that increase soil aeration, e.g., reducing compaction and enhancing soil structure, together with careful selection of fertilizer sources and/or nitrification inhibitors, could decrease N2O production in agricultural soils.}

 journal = {Mar. Pollut. Bull.},
 abstract = {The distribution of the zooplankton community was studied along with environmental factors at five sampling stations in Ghar El Melh Lagoon (GML) (Mediterranean Sea, northern Tunisia). GML is characterized by specific following properties: broad and shallow, freshwater supply (Station 1); connection to the sea (S2); stagnation (S3 especially), and eutrophic conditions with enhanced nutrient concentrations (S4 and S5). Samples were taken twice monthly from February 2011 to January 2012. Twenty-three zooplankton groups comprising 10 larval stages were identified. Zooplankton assemblages were largely dominated by copepods (37.25{\%}), followed respectively by ciliates (21.09{\%}), bivalve larvae (14.88{\%}) and gastropod veligers (12.53{\%}). Redundancy analysis indicated that while no significant difference was found in the distribution of zooplankton at any station, a strong difference was observed according to season. Both temporal and physicochemical fluctuations explain more than 50{\%} of changes in zooplankton abundances.}
